# Graphical analysis of ordinary differential equations

We now proceed from linear ODEs to more complicated nonlinear equations. In contrast to linear differential equations, which can be solved in general, nonlinear differential equations may not be solvable even theoretically. Even though the solutions cannot be written down, they exist and can exhibit much more interesting behaviors than the exponential solutions we have seen. When solutions cannot be found on paper, we have two options: 1) use qualitative or graphical tools, such as finding equilibrium points and their stability, to predict the long-term dynamics of the solution; 2) construct numerical solutions that approximate the true solution. In this chapter we concentrate on the qualitative approach to analyzing ODEs, which allows one to predict the behavior of solutions of any autonomous ODE based on the graph of the defining function of the equation. In this chapter you will learn to do the following:

* find equilibrium values of an ODE
 
* analyze the stability of equilibria based on the graph of the defining function

* write down stability conditions analytically

* use graphical techniques to predict the behavior of the solution of a difference equation without solving it

* build basic compartment epidemiology models
