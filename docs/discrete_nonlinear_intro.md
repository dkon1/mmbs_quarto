# Nonlinear discrete-time dynamic models

In this chapter we will analyze nonlinear discrete dynamical systems. Their solutions, as those of nonlinear ODEs, exhibit much more interesting behaviors than the exponential solutions of linear equations, and are typically not solvable analytically. There may be multiple fixed points, some stable and others unstable, and even crazier behaviors are possible that are not permitted in smooth-flowing ODEs. Specifically, we will see solutions that oscillate, and those that behave without any pattern at all, that are called chaotic. You will learn to do the following in this chapter: 


* build the logistic population model

* find equilibrium values of nonlinear discrete-time models
 
* analyze the stability of equilibria based on the graph of the updating function

* write down stability conditions analytically

* use Python to make cobweb plots

* understand the term chaos
