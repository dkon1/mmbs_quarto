<p>We now proceed from linear ODEs to more complicated nonlinear equations. In contrast to linear differential equations, which can be solved in general, nonlinear differential equations may not be solvable even theoretically. Even though the solutions cannot be written down, they exist and can exhibit much more interesting behaviors than the exponential solutions we have seen. When solutions cannot be found on paper, we have two options: 1) use qualitative or graphical tools, such as finding equilibrium points and their stability, to predict the long-term dynamics of the solution; 2) construct numerical solutions that approximate the true solution. In this chapter we concentrate on the qualitative approach to analyzing ODEs, which allows one to predict the behavior of solutions of any autonomous ODE based on the graph of the defining function of the equation. In this chapter you will learn to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>find equilibrium values of an ODE</p></li>
<li><p>analyze the stability of equilibria based on the graph of the defining function</p></li>
<li><p>write down stability conditions analytically</p></li>
<li><p>use graphical techniques to predict the behavior of the solution of a difference equation without solving it</p></li>
<li><p>build basic compartment epidemiology models</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The simple, linear population growth models we have seen in the last chapter assume that the per capita birth and death rates are constant, that is, they stay the same regardless of population size. The solutions for these models either grow or decay exponentially, but in reality, populations do not grow without bounds. It is generally true that the larger a population grows, the more scarce the resources, and survival becomes more difficult. For larger populations, this could lead to higher death rates, or lower birth rates, or both.</p>
<p>How can we incorporate this effect into a quantitative model? We will assume there are separate birth and death rates, and that the birth rate declines as the population grows, while the death rate increases. Suppose there are inherent birth rates <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, and the overall birth and death rates <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> depend linearly on population size <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(B = b - aP\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D = d + cP\)</span>.</p>
<p>To model the rate of change of the population, we need to multiply the rates <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> by the population size <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, since each individual can reproduce or die. Also, since the death rate <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> decreases the population, we need to put a negative sign on it. The resulting model is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\dot P = BP - DP = [(b-d)-(a+c)P]P
\]</span> (logistic-ode)</p>
<p>The parameters of the model, the constants <span class="math inline">\(a,b,c,d\)</span>, have different meanings. Performing dimensional analysis, we find that <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> have the dimensions of <span class="math inline">\(1/[t]\)</span>, the same as the rate <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> in the exponential growth model. However, the dimensions of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> (and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>) must obey the relation: <span class="math inline">\([P]/[t] = [a][P]^2\)</span>, and thus,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
[a]=[c] = \frac{1}{[t][P]}
\]</span></p>
<p>This shows that the constants <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> have to be treated differently than <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. Let us define the inherent growth rate of the population, to be <span class="math inline">\(r_0=b-d\)</span> (if the death rate is greater than the birth rate, the population will inherently decline). Then let us introduce another constant <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\((a+c)=r_0/K\)</span>. It should be clear from the dimensional analysis that <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> has units of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, population size. Now we can write down the logistic equation in the canonical form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\dot P = r\left(1-\frac{P}{K}\right)P
\]</span></p>
<p>This model can be re-written as <span class="math inline">\(\dot P = aP -bP^2\)</span>, so it is clear that there is a <em>linear term</em> (<span class="math inline">\(aP\)</span>) and a <em>nonlinear term</em> (<span class="math inline">\(-bP^2\)</span>). When <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is sufficiently small(and positive) the linear term is greater, and the population grows. When <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is large enough, the nonlinear term wins and the population declines.</p>
<p>It should be apparent that there are two fixed points, at <span class="math inline">\(P=0\)</span> and at <span class="math inline">\(P=K\)</span>. The first one corresponds to a population with no individuals. On the other hand, <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> signifies the population at which the negative effect of population size balances out the inherent population growth rate, and is called the <em>carrying capacity</em> of a population in its environment <span class="citation" data-cites="otto_biologists_2007">(<a href="references.html#ref-otto_biologists_2007" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>otto_biologists_2007?</strong></a>)</span>. We will analyze the qualitative behavior of the solution, without writing it down, in the next section of this chapter.</p>

<p>In this section we will analyze the behavior of solutions of an autonomous ODE without solving it on paper. Generally, ODE models for realistic biological systems are nonlinear, and most nonlinear differential equations cannot be solved analytically. We can make predictions about the behavior, or <em>dynamics</em> of solutions by considering the properties of the <em>defining function</em>, which is the function on the right-hand-side of a general autonomous ODE:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x)
\]</span></p>
<section id="graphical-analysis-of-the-defining-function" class="level3" data-number="11.2.1">
<h3 data-number="11.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="graphical-analysis-of-the-defining-function"><span class="header-section-number">11.2.1</span> graphical analysis of the defining function</h3>
<p>The defining function relates the value of the solution variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to its rate of change <span class="math inline">\(dx/dt\)</span>. For different values of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, the rate of change of <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> is different, and it is defined by the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. There are only three options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>if <span class="math inline">\(f(x) &gt; 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> is increasing at that value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>if <span class="math inline">\(f(x) &lt; 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> is decreasing at that value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>if <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> is not changing that value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>To determine for which values of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> the solution <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> increases and decreases, it enough to look at the plot of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. On the intervals where the graph of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is above the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> increases, on the intervals where the graph of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is below the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis, <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> decreases. The roots (zeros) of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> are special cases, they separate the range of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> into the intervals where the solution grows and and where it decreases. This seems exceedingly simple, and it is, but it provides specific information about <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span>, without knowing how to write down its formula.</p>
<p>For an autonomous ODE with one dependent variable, the direction of the rate of change prescribed by the differential equation can be graphically represented by sketching the <em>flow on the line</em> of the dependent variable. The flow stands for the direction of change at every point, specifically increasing, decreasing, or not changing. The flow is plotted on the horizontal x-axis, so if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is increasing, the flow will be indicated by a rightward arrow, and if it is decreasing, the flow will point to the left. The fixed points separate the regions of increasing (rightward) flow and decreasing (leftward) flow.</p>
<p><strong>Example.</strong> Consider a linear ODE the likes of which we have solved in section</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = 4x -100
\]</span></p>
<p>The defining function is a straight line vs.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, its graph is shown in figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:ch16_flow_linear}\)</span>a. Based on this graph, we conclude that the solution decreases when <span class="math inline">\(x&lt;25\)</span> and increases when <span class="math inline">\(x&gt;25\)</span>. Thus we can sketch the solution <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> over time, without knowing its functional form. The dynamics depends on the initial value: if <span class="math inline">\(x(0)&lt;25\)</span>, the solution will keep decreasing without bound, and go off to negative infinity; if <span class="math inline">\(x(0)&gt;25\)</span>, the solution will keep decreasing without bound, and go off to positive infinity. This is shown by plotting numerical solutions of this ODE for several initial values in figure <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:ch16_flow_linear}\)</span>b. The dotted line shows the location of the special value of 25 which separates the interval of growth from the interval of decline.</p>
<p><strong>Example.</strong> Now let us analyze a nonlinear ODE, specifically the logistic model with the following parameters:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{dP}{dt} =0.3P\left(1-\frac{P}{40}\right)
\]</span></p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/lec2_fig2.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Flow diagram of the logistic model <span class="math inline">\(\dot P = (1-P/90)P\)</span>; red arrows indicate the direction field in the intervals separated by the fixed points</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The defining function is a downward-facing parabola with two roots at <span class="math inline">\(P=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P=90\)</span>, as shown in {numref}<code>fig-flow-log</code>. Between the two roots, the defining function is positive, which means the derivative <span class="math inline">\(dP/dt\)</span> is positive too, so the solution grows on that interval and approaches the value 90. For <span class="math inline">\(P&lt;0\)</span> the solution decreases without bound; for <span class="math inline">\(P&gt;90\)</span> the solution also decreases and converges to 90, since a solution cannot go through a value at which its derivative is 0.</p>
<p><strong>Example: semi-stable fixed point.</strong> Let un analyze another nonlinear ODE</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{dx}{dt} =  -x^3 + x^2
\]</span></p>
<p>The flow of the solutions is plotted in {numref}<code>fig-flow-semi</code>, showing two fixed points at <span class="math inline">\(x = 0, 1\)</span>. The red arrows on the x-axis show the direction of the flow in the three different regions separated by the zeros of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(x &lt; 0\)</span>, solutions decrease without bound; for <span class="math inline">\(0&lt;x&lt;1\)</span> solutions increase and approach 1 and for <span class="math inline">\(x&gt;1\)</span> solutions decrease and approach 1.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p>To summarize, the defining function of the ODE determines the rate of change of the solution <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> depending on the value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. The graphical approach to finding areas of right and left flow is based on graphing the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, and dividing the x-axis based on the sign of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. In the areas where <span class="math inline">\(f(x) &gt; 0\)</span>, its graph is above the x-axis, and the flow is to the right; conversely, when <span class="math inline">\(f(x) &lt; 0\)</span>, its graph is below the x-axis, and the flow is to the left. The next subsection puts this approach in a more analytic framework.</p>

<p>We have seen that the dynamics of solutions of differential equations depend on the initial value of the dependent variable: for some values the solution increases, for others it decreases, and for intermediate values it remains the same. Those special values separating intervals of increase and decrease are called fixed points (or equilibria), and the first step to understanding the dynamics of an ODE is finding its fixed points. A fixed point is a value of the solution at which the dynamical system stays constant, thus, the derivative of the solution must be zero. Here is the formal definition:</p>

<p>For an ordinary differential equation <span class="math inline">\(\dot x = f(x)\)</span>, a point <span class="math inline">\(x^*\)</span> which satisfies <span class="math inline">\(f(x^*)=0\)</span> is called a <em>fixed point</em> or <em>equilibrium</em>, and the solution with the initial condition <span class="math inline">\(x(0)=x^*\)</span> is constant over time <span class="math inline">\(x(t)=x^*\)</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Example.</strong> The linear equation <span class="math inline">\(\dot x = rx\)</span> has a single fixed point at <span class="math inline">\(x^* = 0\)</span>. For a more interesting example, consider a logistic equation: <span class="math inline">\(\dot x = x - x^2\)</span>. Its fixed points are the solutions of <span class="math inline">\(x - x^2 = 0\)</span>, therefore there two fixed points: <span class="math inline">\(x^* = 0, 1\)</span>. We know that if the solution has either of the fixed points as the initial condition, it will remain at that value for all time.</p>
<p>Locating the fixed points is not sufficient to predict the global behavior of the dynamical system, however. What happens to the solution of a dynamical system if the initial condition is very close to an equilibrium, but not precisely at it? Put another way, what happens if the equilibrium is perturbed? The solution may be attracted to the equilibrium value, that is, it approaches it ever-closer, or else it is not. In the first case, this is called a stable equilibrium, because a small perturbation does not dramatically change the long-term behavior of the solution. In the latter case, the equilibrium is called unstable, and the solution perturbed from the equilibrium never returns. These concepts are formalized in the following definition</p>

<p>A fixed point <span class="math inline">\(x^*\)</span> of an ODE <span class="math inline">\(\dot x = f(x)\)</span> is called a <em>stable</em> fixed point (or sink) if for a sufficiently small number <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>, the solution <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> with the initial condition <span class="math inline">\(x_0 = x^* + \epsilon\)</span> approaches the fixed point <span class="math inline">\(x^*\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(t \rightarrow \infty\)</span>. If the solution <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> does not approach <span class="math inline">\(x^*\)</span> for all nonzero <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>, the fixed point is called an <em>unstable</em> fixed point (or source).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To determine whether a fixed point is stable analytically we use the approach called <em>linearization</em>, which involves replacing the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> with a linear approximation. Let us define <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon(t)\)</span> to be the deviation of the solution <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> from the fixed point <span class="math inline">\(x^*\)</span>, so we can write <span class="math inline">\(x(t) = x^* + \epsilon(t)\)</span>. Assuming that <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon(t)\)</span> is small, we can write the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> using Taylor’s formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(x^*+\epsilon(t))= f(x^*)+f'(x^*) \epsilon(t) + ... = f'(x^*) \epsilon(t) + ...
\]</span></p>
<p>The term <span class="math inline">\(f(x^*)\)</span> vanished because it is zero by definition <span class="math inline">\(\ref{def:ch16_fixedpt}\)</span> of a fixed point. The ellipsis indicates all the terms of order <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon(t)^2\)</span> and higher, which are very small if <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon(t)\)</span> is small, and thus can be neglected. Thus, we can write the following approximation to the ODE <span class="math inline">\(\dot x = f(x)\)</span> near a fixed point:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\dot x =  \frac{d(x^* + \epsilon(t))}{dt} = \dot \epsilon(t) =  f'(x^*) \epsilon(t)
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus we replaced the complicated nonlinear ODE near a fixed point with a linear equation, which approximates the dynamics of the deviation <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon(t)\)</span> near the fixed point <span class="math inline">\(x^*\)</span>; note that the derivative <span class="math inline">\(f'(x^*)\)</span> is a constant for any given fixed point. In section <span class="math inline">\(\ref{sec:math15}\)</span> we classified the behavior of solutions for the general linear ODE <span class="math inline">\(\dot x = rx\)</span>, and now we apply this classification to the behavior of the deviation <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon(t)\)</span>. If the multiple <span class="math inline">\(f'(x^*)\)</span> is positive, the deviation <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon(t)\)</span> is growing, the solution is diverging away from the fixed point, and thus the fixed point is unstable. If the multiple <span class="math inline">\(f'(x^*)\)</span> is negative, the deviation <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon(t)\)</span> is decaying, the solution is converging to the fixed point, and thus the fixed point is stable. Finally, there is the borderline case of <span class="math inline">\(f'(x^*) = 0\)</span> which is inconclusive, and the fixed point may be either stable or unstable. The derivative stability analysis is summarized in the following:</p>

Important Fact
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>For an autonomous ODE in the form <span class="math inline">\(\dot x = f(x)\)</span>, a fixed point <span class="math inline">\(x^*\)</span> can be classified as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f'(x^*) &gt; 0\)</span>: the slope of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> at the fixed point is positive, then the fixed point is .</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f'(x^*) &lt; 0\)</span>: the slope of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> at the fixed point is negative, then the fixed point is .</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f'(x^*) = 0\)</span>: stability cannot be determined from the derivative.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>Therefore, knowing the derivative or the slope of the defining function at the fixed point is enough to know its stability. If the derivative has the discourtesy of being zero, the situation is tricky, because then higher order terms that we neglected make the difference. We will mostly avoid such borderline cases, but they are important in some applications <span class="citation" data-cites="strogatz_nonlinear_2001">(<a href="references.html#ref-strogatz_nonlinear_2001" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>strogatz_nonlinear_2001?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>

<p>To summarize, here is an outline of the steps for analyzing the behavior of solutions of an autonomous one-variable ODE. These tasks can be accomplished either by plotting the defining function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> and finding the fixed points and their stability based on the plot, or by solving for the fixed points on paper, then finding the derivative <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> and plugging in the values of the fixed points to determine their stability. Either approach is valid, but the analytic methods are necessary when dealing with models that have unknown parameter values, which makes it impossible to represent the defining function in a plot.</p>

<p>The field of <em>epidemiology</em> studies the distribution of disease and health states in populations. Epidemiologists describe and model these issues with the goal of helping public health workers devise interventions to improve the overall health outcomes on a large scale. One particular topic of interest is the the spread of infectious disease and how best tor respond to it.. Because epidemiology is concerned with large numbers of people, the models used in the field do not address the details of an individual disease history. One approach to modeling this is to put people into categories, such as <em>susceptible</em> (those who can be infected but are not), <em>infectious</em> (those who are infected and can spread the disease), and <em>recovered</em> (those who cannot be infected or spread disease, shown in {numref}<code>fig-sir-model</code>. This type of models is called a <em>compartment model</em> and they are they commonly used to represent infectious disease on a population level both for deterministic models (e.g.&nbsp;ODEs) and stochastic models (e.g.&nbsp;Markov models). Dividing people into categories involves the assumption that everyone in a particular category behaves in the same manner: for instance, all susceptible people are infected with the same rate and all infected people recover with the same rate.</p>

<p>Let us construct an ODE to describe a two-compartment epidemiology model. There are two dependent variables to be tracked: the number of susceptible (<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>) and infected (<span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>) individuals in the population. The susceptible individuals can get infected, while the infected ones can recover and become susceptible again. The implicit assumption is that there is no immunity, and recovered individuals can get infected with the same ease as those who were never infected. There are some human diseases for which this is true, for instance the common cold or gonorrhea. Transitions between the different classes of individuals can be summarized by the scheme in figure</p>

<p>Here <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is the individual rate of infection, also known as the transmission rate, and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is the individual rate of recovery. There is an important distinction between the processes of infection and recovery: the former requires an infected individual and a susceptible individual, while the latter needs only an infected individual. Therefore, it is reasonable to suppose that the rate of growth of infected individuals is the product of the individual transmission rate <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and the product of the number of infected and susceptible individuals. The overall rate of recovery is the individual recovery rate <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> multiplied by the number of the infected. This leads to the following two differential equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot S &amp;=&amp; -\beta IS + \gamma I \\
\dot I &amp;=&amp; \beta I S - \gamma I
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that, as in the chemical kinetics models, the two equations add up to zero on the right hand side, leading to the conclusion that <span class="math inline">\(\dot S + \dot I = 0\)</span>. Therefore, the total number of people is a conserved quantity <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, which does not change. This makes sense since we did not consider any births or deaths in the ODE model, only transitions between susceptible and infected individuals.</p>
<p>We can use the conserved quantity <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> to reduce the two equations to one, by the substitution of <span class="math inline">\(S = N -I\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\dot I  =  \beta I (N - I) - \gamma I
\]</span></p>
<p>This model may be analyzed using qualitative methods that were developed in this chapter, allowing prediction of the dynamics of the fraction of infected for different transmission and recovery rates. First, let us find the fixed points of the differential equation. Setting the equation to zero, we find:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
0  =  \beta I (N - I) - \gamma I \Rightarrow I^* = 0; \; I^* =  N - \gamma/\beta
\]</span></p>
<p>This means that there are two equilibrium levels of infection: either nobody is infected (<span class="math inline">\(I^* = 0\)</span>) or there is some persistent number of infected individuals ($ I^* = N - /$). Notice that the second fixed point is only biologically relevant if $N &gt; /$.</p>
<p>Use the derivative test to check for stability. First, find the general expression for derivative of the defining function: $f’(I) = -2 I + N - $.</p>
<p>The stability of the fixed point <span class="math inline">\(I^* = 0\)</span> is found by plugging in this value into the derivative formula: <span class="math inline">\(f'(0) = \beta N - \gamma\)</span>. We learned in section <span class="math inline">\(\ref{sec:math16}\)</span> that a fixed point is stable if the derivative of the defining function is negative. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(I^* = 0\)</span> is stable if <span class="math inline">\(\gamma - \beta N &gt; 0\)</span>, and unstable otherwise. This gives us a <em>stability condition</em> on the values of the biological parameters. If the recovery rate <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is greater than the rate of infection for the population (the transmission rate multiplied by the population size) <span class="math inline">\(\beta N\)</span>, then the no-infection equilibrium is stable. This predicts that the infection dies out if the recovery rate is faster than the rate of infection, which makes biological sense.</p>
<p>Similarly, we find the stability of the second fixed point <span class="math inline">\(I^* = N - \gamma/\beta\)</span> by substituting its value into the derivative, to obtain <span class="math inline">\(f'(N - \gamma/\beta) = \gamma - \beta N\)</span>. By the same logic, as above, this fixed point is stable if <span class="math inline">\(\gamma - \beta N &lt; 0\)</span>, or if <span class="math inline">\(\gamma &lt; \beta N\)</span>. This is a complementary condition for the fixed point at 0, that is, only one fixed point can be stable for any given parameter values. In the biological interpretation, if the transmission rate <span class="math inline">\(\beta N\)</span> is greater than the recovery rate <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, then the epidemic will persist.</p>
<p>We can use our graphical analysis skills to illustrate the situation. Consider a situation in which <span class="math inline">\(\gamma &lt; \beta N\)</span>. As predicted by stability analysis, the zero infection equilibrium should be unstable, and the equilibrium at <span class="math inline">\(N - \gamma/\beta\)</span> should be stable. In order to plot the function $f(I) = I (N - I) - I $, we choose the specific parameter values and plot the definining function in {numref}<code>fig-sis-beta</code>. The direction of the flow on the <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>-axis prescribed by the defining function <span class="math inline">\(f(I)\)</span> shows that solutions approach the fixed point at <span class="math inline">\(N - \gamma/\beta\)</span> from both directions, which make it a stable fixed point, while diverging from <span class="math inline">\(I=0\)</span>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if <span class="math inline">\(\gamma &gt; \beta N\)</span>, stability analysis predicts that the no-infection equilibrium (<span class="math inline">\(I=0\)</span>) is stable. {numref}<code>fig-sis-gamma</code> shows the plot of the defining function where the effective infection rate <span class="math inline">\(\beta N\)</span> is greater than the recovery rate <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>. The flow on the <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>-axis is toward the zero equilibrium, therefore it is stable. Note that the second equilibrium at <span class="math inline">\(I^* = N - \gamma/\beta\)</span> is negative, and thus has no biological significance. The solutions, if the initial value is positive, all approach 0, so the infection inevitably dies out.</p>

<p>Mathematical modeling of epidemiology has been a success story in the last few decades. Public health workers routinely estimate the parameter called the <em>basic reproductive number</em> <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> defined to be the average number of new infections caused by a single infected individual in a susceptible population. This number comes out of our analysis above, where we found <span class="math inline">\(R_0 = N \beta / \gamma\)</span> to determine whether or not an epidemic persisted <span class="citation" data-cites="brauer_mathematical_2011">(<a href="references.html#ref-brauer_mathematical_2011" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>brauer_mathematical_2011?</strong></a>)</span>. This number is critical in more sophisticated models of epidemiology.</p>
<p>Mathematical models are used to predict the time course of an epidemic, called the <em>epidemic curve</em> and then advise on the public health interventions that can reduce the number of affected individuals. In reality, most epidemic curves have the shape similar to the data from the Ebola virus epidemic in {numref}<code>fig-ebola1</code> and {numref}<code>fig-ebola2</code>. Most such curves show an initial increase in infections, peaking, and the declining to low levels, which is fundamentally different than the solution curves we obtained from the two-compartment model. To describe dynamics of this nature, models with more than two variables are needed, such as classic three-compartment SIR models (susceptible-infected-recovered) models and their modifications <span class="citation" data-cites="brauer_mathematical_2011">(<a href="references.html#ref-brauer_mathematical_2011" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>brauer_mathematical_2011?</strong></a>)</span>. Being able to predict the future of an epidemic based on <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> and other parameters allows public health officials to prepare and deploy interventions (vaccinations, quarantine, etc.) that have the best shot at minimizing the epidemic.</p>
