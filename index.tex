\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface}

In this book you will find a collection of mathematical ideas,
computational methods, and modeling tools for describing biological
systems quantitatively. Biological science, like all natural sciences,
is driven by experimental results. As with other sciences, there comes a
point when accumulated data needs to be analyzed quantitatively, in
order to formulate and test explanatory hypotheses. Biology has reached
this stage, thanks to an explosion of data from molecular biology
techniques, such as large-scale DNA sequencing, protein structure
determination, data on gene regulatory networks, and signaling pathways.
Quantitative skills have become necessary for anyone hoping to make
sense of biological research.

Mathematical modeling necessarily involves making simplifying
assumptions. Reality is generally too complex to be captured in a few
equations, and this is especially true for living systems. Simplicity in
modeling has at least two virtues: first, simple models can be grasped
by our limited minds, and second, it allows for meaningful testing of
the assumptions against the evidence. A complex model that fits the data
may not provide any insights about how the system works, whereas a
simple model which does not fit all the data can indicate where the
assumptions break down. We will learn how to construct progressively
more sophisticated models, beginning with the ridiculously simple.

\section*{modeling assumptions: theoretical and
empirical}\label{modeling-assumptions-theoretical-and-empirical}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{modeling assumptions: theoretical and
empirical}

A mathematical model postulates a precise relationship between several
quantities, attempting to mimic the behavior of a real system. All
models rest on a set of assumptions, postulating how various quantities
are interrelated. These assumptions generally come from two sources: a
scientific theory, or experimental observations. For instance, a model
of molecular motion may rest on the assumption that Newton's laws hold
true. On the other hand, the observation that a drug injected into the
bloodstream of a mammal is metabolized with an exponential time
dependence is empirical. The benefit of models based on well-established
theories, sometimes known as ``first-principles models'', is that they
can be constructed without prior experimental knowledge of a particular
system. Newton's laws apply to all sorts of classical mechanics objects,
ranging in size from molecules to planets. Some prefer first-principles
models, because they rely on well-established scientific principles,
while others will argue that an empirical model more accurately reflects
the behavior of the system at hand. From a mathematical standpoint,
there is no difference between the two types of models. We will use the
same tools to construct and analyze models, regardless of their origin.

A stated assumption can be written as a mathematical relationship,
usually in the form of an equation relating quantities of interest. A
postulated assumption may be expressed in words as ``\(X\) is
proportional to \(Y\)'', and can be written as the following equation:
\(X = aY\). Another model may postulate a relationship ``\(X\) is
inversely proportional to the product of \(Y\) and \(Z\)'', which is
expressed as \(X = a/YZ\).

Suppose we want to model the relationship between the height of
individuals (\(H\)) and their weight (\(W\)). Measuring those quantities
in some population results in the observation that the weight is
proportional to the height, with an additive correction. Then we can
write the following mathematical model, based on the empirical evidence:
\(W = a H + c\)

In electricity, Ohm's law governs the relationship between the flow of
charged particles, called current (\(I\)), the electric potential
(\(V\)) and the resistance of a conductor (\(R\)). This law states that
the current through a conductor is proportional to the potential and
inversely proportional to the resistance, and thus can be mathematically
formulated:

\[
I = \frac{V}{R}
\]

\hypertarget{variables-and-parameters}{%
\section*{variables and parameters}\label{variables-and-parameters}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{variables and parameters}

Mathematical models formulate relationships between different quantities
that can be measured in real systems. There are two different types of
quantities in models: \emph{variables} and \emph{parameters}. The same
measurable quantity can be a variable or a parameter, depending on the
role it plays in the model. A variable typically varies, either in time
or in space, and the model tracks the changes in its value. On the other
hand, a parameter typically usually stays the same for a particular
manifestation of the model, e.g.~an individual or a specific population.
However, parameters can vary from individual to individual, or from
population to population.

In the height and weight model above, the numbers \(H\) are \(W\) are
the variables, which can change between different individuals. The
parameters \(a\) and \(c\) can either be estimated from data for various
subpopulations. Perhaps the values of the parameters are different for
young people than for older people, or they are different for those who
exercise regularly versus those who do not. Once the parameters have
been set, one can predict \(W\) given \(H\), or vice versa. Of course,
since this is a model, it is only an approximation of reality. The
deviations of predictions of the model from actual height or weight for
an individual may tell us something interesting about the physiology of
the individual.

There are three quantities in the equation for Ohm's law, and the
distinction between variables and parameters depends on the actual
system that is being modeled. In order to distinguish between the two,
consider which quantity is set prior to the experiment, and which one
may vary over the course of the situation we are trying to model. For
instance, if voltage is being applied to a material with constant
resistance, and the potential may be varied, then \(V\) is the
independent variable, \(I\) is the dependent variable, and \(R\) is a
parameter. On the other hand, if the setup uses a variable resistor
(known as a potentiometer or pot), and the voltage remains constant,
then \(V\) is a parameter, while \(I\) and \(R\) are variables. If both
the voltage \(V\) and the resistance \(R\) can vary at the same time,
then all three quantities are variables.

\hypertarget{units-and-dimensions}{%
\section*{units and dimensions}\label{units-and-dimensions}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{units and dimensions}

Each variable and parameter has its own \emph{dimension}, which
describes the physical or biological meaning of the quantity. Examples
are time, length, number of individuals, or concentration per time. It
is important to distinguish the dimension of a quantity from the
\emph{units} of measurement. The same quantity can be measured in
different units: length can be in meters or feet, population size can be
expressed in individuals or millions of individuals. The value of a
quantity depends on the units of measurement, but its essential
dimensionality does not.

There is a fundamental requirement of mathematical modeling: all the
terms in an equation must agree in dimensionality; e.g.~time cannot be
added to number of sheep, since this sum has no biological meaning. In
order to express this rule, we will write the dimension of a quantity
\(X\) as \([X]\). While \(X\) refers to a numerical value, \([X]\)
describes its physical meaning. Then the above statement can be
illustrated by the following example:

\[
aX = bY^2 \; => \; [aX] = [bY^2]
\]

In the equation \$W = a H + c \$ all the terms must have the dimension
of weight, because that is the meaning of the left hand side of the
equation. Therefore, \(c\) has the dimensions of weight as well. \(H\)
of course has the dimension of length, so this implies that the
parameter \(a\) has dimensions of weight divided by length. This can be
summed up as follows:

\[
[W] = [c] = weight ; \; [H] = length ; \; [a] = \frac{weight }{length}
\]

While the dimensions are set by the equation, the units of these
quantities can vary. Weight can be expressed in pounds, kilograms, or
stones, and length can be represented in inches, meters, or light years.

The dimensions of current are defined to be the amount of charge moving
per unit of time, and the dimensions of voltage are energy per unit of
charge. This allows us to find the dimensions of resistance by the
following basic algebra:

\[
[V] = \frac{energy}{charge} = \frac{[I]}{[R]} = \frac{charge/time}{[R]} \; => \; [R] = \frac{charge^2}{energy *time}
\]

Electric potential is measured in volts, and current in amperes. The
standard unit of resistance is the Ohm, which is defined as one volt per
ampere. But regardless of the choice of units, the dimensions of these
quantities remains.

A quantity may be made \emph{dimensionless} by expressing it in terms of
particular \emph{scale}. For instance, we can express the height of a
person as a fraction of the mean height of the population. A tall person
will have height expressed as a number greater than 1, and a short one
will have height less than 1. Note that this dimensionless height has no
units - they have been divided out by scaling the height by the mean
height. In fact, the word dimensionless is somewhat misleading: while
such quantities have no scale in the context of the algebraic
relationship, a quantity retains its physical significance after
rescaling: height expressed as a fraction of some chosen length still
represents height. Nevertheless, the accepted term in dimensionless
quantity, and we will stick with this convention. Later in the book we
will learn how to use the technique of rescaling to simplify and analyze
dynamic models.

\chapter{One variable in discrete
time}\label{one-variable-in-discrete-time}}

All living things change over time, and this evolution can be
quantitatively measured and analyzed. Mathematics makes use of equations
to define models that change with time, known as \emph{dynamical
systems}. In this unit we will learn how to construct models that
describe the time-dependent behavior of some measurable quantity in life
sciences. Numerous fields of biology use such models, and in particular
we will consider changes in population size, the progress of biochemical
reactions, the spread of infectious disease, and the spikes of membrane
potentials in neurons, as some of the main examples of biological
dynamical systems.

Many processes in living things happen regularly, repeating with a
fairly constant time period. One common example is the reproductive
cycle in species that reproduce periodically, whether once a year, or
once an hour, like certain bacteria that divide at a relatively constant
rate under favorable conditions. Other periodic phenomena include
circadian (daily) cycles in physiology, contractions of the heart
muscle, and waves of neural activity. For these processes, theoretical
biologists use models with \emph{discrete time}, in which the time
variable is restricted to the integers. For instance, it is natural to
count the generations in whole numbers when modeling population growth.

This chapter is devoted to analyzing dynamical systems in which time is
measured in discrete steps. We will build dynamic models, find their
mathematical solutions, and then use Python to compute the solutions and
plot them. In this chapter you will learn to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  build discrete-time models of populations using rate paramaters
\item
  define and verify mathematical solutions of these models
\item
  use Python to compute and plot solutions
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{building-dynamic-models}{%
\section{Building dynamic models}\label{building-dynamic-models}}

Let us construct our first models of biological systems! We will start
by considering a population of some species, with the goal of tracking
its growth or decay over time. The variable of interest is the number of
individuals in the population, which we will call \(N\). This is called
the dependent variable, since its value changes depending on time; it
would make no sense to say that time changes depending on the population
size. Throughout the study of dynamical systems, we will denote the
independent variable of time by \(t\). To denote the population size at
time \(t\), we can write \(N(t)\) but sometimes use \(N_t\).

\hypertarget{static-population}{%
\subsection{static population}\label{static-population}}

In order to describe the dynamics, we need to write down a rule for how
the population changes. Consider the simplest case, in which the
population stays the same for all time. (Maybe it is a pile of rocks?)
Then the following equation describes this situation:

\[
N(t+1) = N(t)
\]

This equation mandates that the population at the next time step be the
same as at the present time \(t\). This type of equation is generally
called a \emph{difference equation}, because it can be written as a
difference between the values at the two different times:

\[
N(t+1) - N(t) = 0
\]

This version of the model illustrates that a difference equation at its
core describes the \emph{increments} of \(N\) from one time step to the
next. In this case, the increments are always 0, which makes it plain
that the population does not change from one time step to the next.

\hypertarget{exponential-population-growth}{%
\subsection{exponential population
growth}\label{exponential-population-growth}}

Let us consider a more interesting situation: as a colony of dividing
bacteria. such as \emph{E. coli}, shown in
\{numref\}\texttt{fig-cell-div}. We assume that each bacterial cell
divides and produces two daughter cells at fixed intervals of time, and
let us further suppose that bacteria never die. Essentially, we are
assuming a population of immortal bacteria with clocks. This means that
after each cell division the population size doubles. As before, we
denote the number of cells in each generation by \(N(t)\), and obtain
the equation describing each successive generation:

\[
N(t+1) = 2N(t)
\]

It can also be written in the difference form, as above:

\[
N(t+1) - N(t) = N(t)
\]

The increment in population size is determined by the current population
size, so the population in this model is forever growing. This type of
behavior is termed \emph{exponential growth} and we will see how to
express the solution algebraically in the next section.

\hypertarget{example-with-birth-and-death}{%
\subsection{example with birth and
death}\label{example-with-birth-and-death}}

Suppose that a type of fish lives to reproduce only once after a period
of maturation, after which the adults die. In this simple scenario, half
of the population is female, a female always lays 1000 eggs, and of
those, 1\% survive to maturity and reproduce. Let us set up the model
for the population growth of this idealized fish population. The general
idea, as before, is to relate the population size at the next time step
\(N(t+1)\) to the population at the present time \(N(t)\).

Let us tabulate both the increases and the decreases in the population
size. We have \(N(t)\) fish at the present time, but we know they all
die after reproducing, so there is a decrease of \(N(t)\) in the
population. Since half of the population is female, the number of new
offspring produced by \(N(t)\) fish is \(500N(t)\). Of those, only 1\%
survive to maturity (the next time step), and the other 99\%
(\(495N(t)\)) die. We can add all the terms together to obtain the
following difference equation:

\[
N(t+1) = N(t) - N(t) + 500N(t) - 495 N(t)  = 5N(t)
\]

The number 500 in the expression is the \emph{birth rate} of the
population per individual, and the negative terms add up to the
\emph{death rate} of 496 per individual. We can re-write the equation in
difference form:

\[
N(t+1) - N(t) = 4N(t)
\]

This expression again generates growth in the population, because the
birth rate outweighs the death rate.
(\textbf{allman\_mathematical\_2003?})

\hypertarget{dimensions-of-birth-and-death-rates}{%
\subsection{dimensions of birth and death
rates}\label{dimensions-of-birth-and-death-rates}}

What distinguishes a mathematical model from a mathematical equation is
that the quantities involved have a real-world meaning. Each quantity
represents a measurement, and associated with each one are the
\emph{units} of measurement, which are familiar from science courses. In
addition to units, each variable and parameter has a meaning, which is
called the \emph{dimension} of the quantity. For example, any
measurement of length or distance has the same dimension, although the
units may vary. The value of a quantity depends on the units of
measurement, but its essential dimensionality does not. One can convert
a measurement in meters to that in light-years or cubits, but one cannot
convert a measurement in number of sheep to seconds - that conversion
has no meaning.

Thus leads us to the fundamental rule of mathematical modeling:
\textbf{terms that are added or subtracted must have the same
dimension}. This gives mathematical modelers a useful tool called
\emph{dimensional analysis}, which involves replacing the quantities in
an equation with their dimensions. This serves as a check that all
dimensions match, as well as allowing to deduce the dimensions of any
parameters for which the dimension was not specified.

In the case of population models, the birth and death rates measure the
number of individuals that are born (or die) within a reproductive cycle
for every individual at the present time. Their dimensions must be such
that the terms in the equation all match:

\[
[N(t+1) - N(t)] = [population] = [r] [N(t)] = [r] *[population]
\]

This implies that \([r]\) is algebraically dimensionless. However, the
meaning of \(r\) is the rate of change of population over one
(generation) time step. \(r\) is the birth or death rate of the
population \emph{per generation}, which is what makes is dimensionless.
If the length of the generation were to change, but the reproduction and
death per generation remain the same, then the paramter \(r\) would be
the same, because it had been \emph{rescaled} by the length of the
generation. If they were to be reported in \emph{absolute} units
(e.g.~individuals per year) then the rate would be different.

\hypertarget{general-demographic-model}{%
\subsection{general demographic model}\label{general-demographic-model}}

We will now write a general difference equation for any population with
constant birth and death rates. This will allow us to substitute
arbitrary values of the birth and death rates to model different
biological situations. Suppose that a population has the birth rate of
\(b\) per individual, and the death rate \(d\) per individual. Then the
general model of the population size is:

\[
N(t+1) = (1 + b - d)N(t)
\] (lin-pop)

The general equation also allows us to check the dimensions of birth and
death rates, especially as written in the incremental form:
\(N(t+1) - N(t) = (b - d)N(t)\). The change in population rate over one
reproductive cycle is given by the current population size multiplied by
the difference of birth and death rates, which as we saw are
algebraically dimensionless. The right hand side of the equation has the
dimensions of population size, matching the difference on the left hand
side. (\textbf{edelstein-keshet\_mathematical\_2005?})

\section{Solutions of linear difference
models}\label{solutions-of-linear-difference-models}}

We saw in the last section that we can write down equations to describe,
step by step, how a variable changes over time. Let us define what the
terminology of these equations:

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, leftrule=.75mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, breakable, opacityback=0, colback=white, toprule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomtitle=1mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, rightrule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Definition}]
An equation to describe a variable (e.g.~N) that changes over discrete
time steps described by the integer variable \(t\) is called a
\emph{difference equation} or a \emph{discrete-time dynamic model}.
These equations can be written in two ways, either in \emph{recurrent
form}:

\[
N(t+1) = f(N(t))
\] (recur-eq)

or in \emph{increment form}:

\[
N(t+1) - N(t) = g(N(t))
\] (recur-eq)
\end{tcolorbox}

\hypertarget{simple-linear-difference-models}{%
\subsection{simple linear difference
models}\label{simple-linear-difference-models}}

Having set up the difference equation models, we would naturally like to
solve them to find out how the dependent variable, such as population
size, varies over time. A solution may be \emph{analytic}, meaning that
it can be written as a formula, or \emph{numeric}, in which case it is
generated by a computer in the form of a sequence of values of the
dependent variable over a period of time. In this section, we will find
some simple analytic solutions and learn to analyze the behavior of
difference equations which we cannot solve exactly.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, leftrule=.75mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, breakable, opacityback=0, colback=white, toprule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomtitle=1mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, rightrule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Definition}]
A function \(N(t)\) is a \emph{solution} of a difference equation
\(N(t+1) = f(N(t))\) if it satisfies that equation for all values of
time \(t\).
\end{tcolorbox}

For instance, let us take our first model of the static population,
\(N(t+1) = N(t)\). Any constant function is a solution, for example,
\(N(t) = 0\), or \(N(t) = 10\). There are actually as many solutions as
there are numbers, that is, infinitely many! In order to specify exactly
what happens in the model, we need to specify the size of the population
at some point, usually, at the ``beginning of time'', \(t = 0\). This is
called the \emph{initial condition} for the model, and for a
well-behaved difference equation it is enough to determine a unique
solution. For the static model, specifying the initial condition is the
same as specifying the population size for all time.

Now let us look at the general model of population growth with constant
birth and death rates. We saw in equation \{eq\}\texttt{lin-pop} above
that these can be written in the form \(N(t+1) = (1 + b - d) N(t)\). To
simplify, let us combine the numbers into one growth parameter
\(r = 1 + b - d\), and write down the general equation for population
growth with constant growth rate:

\[
N(t+1) =  rN(t)
\] (lin-pop-r)

To find the solution, consider a specific example, where we start with
the initial population size \(N_0 = 1\), and the growth rate \(r=2\).
The sequence of population sizes is: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. This is
described by the formula \(N(t) = 2^t\).

In the general case, each time step the solution is multiplied by \(r\),
so the solution has the same exponential form. The initial condition
\(N_0\) is a multiplicative constant in the solution, and one can verify
that when \(t=0\), the solution matches the initial value:

\[
N(t)  = r^t N_0
\] (lin-pop-sol)

I would like the reader to pause and consider this remarkable formula.
No matter what the birth and death parameters are selected, this
solution predicts the population size at any point in time \(t\).

In order to verify that the formula for \(N(t)\) is actually a solution
in the meaning of definition, we need to check that it actually
satisfies the difference equation for all \(t\), not just a few time
steps. This can be done algebraically by plugging in \(N(t+1)\) into the
left side of the dynamic model and \(N(t)\) into the right side and
checking whether they match. For \(N(t)\) given by equation
\{eq\}\texttt{lin-pop-sol}, \(N(t+1) = r^{t+1} N_0\), and thus the
dynamic model becomes:

\[
r^{t+1} N_0 = r \times r^t N_0
\]

Since the two sides match, this means the solution is correct.

The solutions in equation \{eq\}\texttt{lin-pop-sol} are exponential
functions, which have a limited menu of behaviors, depending on the
value of \(r\). If \(r > 1\), multiplication by \(r\) increases the size
of the population, so the solution \(N(t)\) will grow (see
\{numref\}\texttt{fig-exp-growth}. If \(r < 1\), multiplication by \(r\)
decreases the size of the population, so the solution \(N(t)\) will
decay (see \{numref\}\texttt{fig-exp-decay}). Finally, if \(r=1\),
multiplication by \(r\) leaves the population size unchanged, like in
the pile of rocks model. Here is the complete classification of the
behavior of population models with constant birth and death rates
(assuming \(r>0\)):

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, leftrule=.75mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, breakable, opacityback=0, colback=white, toprule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomtitle=1mm, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, rightrule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, title={Classification of solutions of linear dynamic models}]

For a difference equation \(N(t+1) = rN(t)\), solutions can behave in
one of three ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(|r| > 1\): \(N(t)\) grows without bound
\item
  \(|r| < 1\): \(N(t)\) decays to 0
\item
  \(|r| = 1\): the absolute value of \(N(t)\) remains constant
\end{itemize}

\end{tcolorbox}

\hypertarget{linear-difference-models-with-a-constant-term}{%
\subsection{linear difference models with a constant
term}\label{linear-difference-models-with-a-constant-term}}

Now let us consider a dynamic model that combines two different rates: a
proportional rate (\(rN\)) and a constant rate which does not depend on
the value of the variable \(N\). We can write such a generic model as
follows:

\[
N(t+1) =  rN(t) + a
\]

The right-hand-side of this equation is a linear function of \(N\), so
this is a linear difference equation with a constant term. What function
\(N(t)\) satisfies it? One can quickly check that that the same solution
\(N(t) = r^t N_0\) does not work because of the pesky constant term
\(a\):

\[
r^{t+1} N_0 \neq r \times r^t N_0 + a
\]

To solve it, we need to try a different form: specifically, an
exponential with an added constant. The exponential can be reasonably
surmised to have base \(r\) as before, and then leave the two constants
as unknown: \(N(t) = c_1 r^t + c_2\). To figure out whether this is a
solution, plug it into the linear difference equation above and check
whether a choice of constants can make the two sides agree:

\[
N(t+1) =  c_1 r^{t +1} + c_2 = rN(t) + a  = rc_1 r^t + rc_2+ a
\]

This equation has the same term \(c_1 r^{t +1}\) on both sides, so they
can be subtracted out. The remaining equation involves only \(c_2\), and
its solution is \(c_2 = a/(1-r)\). Therefore, the general solution of
this linear difference equation is the following expreis which is
determined from the initial value by plugging \(t=0\) and solving for
\(c\).

\[
N(t) = c r^t  + \frac{a}{1-r}
\label{eq:ch14_sol_wconst}
\]

\textbf{Example.} Take the difference equation
\(N(t+1) = 0.5 N(t) + 40\) with initial value \(N(0)= 100\). The
solution, according to our formula is \(N(t) = c 0.5^t + 80\). At
\(N(0) = 100 = c+80\), so \(c=20\). Then the compete solution is
\(N(t) = 20*0.5^t + 80\). To check that this actually works, plug this
solution back into the difference equation:

\[
N(t+1) = 20 \times 0.5^{t+1} + 80 = 0.5 \times (20 \times 0.5^t + 80) + 40 =  20 \times 0.5^{t+1} + 80
\]

The equation is satisfied and therefore the solution is correct.

\section{Numeric solutions of discrete
models}\label{numeric-solutions-of-discrete-models}}

Difference equations, as we saw above, can be written in the form of
\(x_{t+1} = f(x_t)\). At every step, the model takes the current value
of the dependent variable \(x_t\), feeds it into the function \(f(x)\),
and takes the output as the next value \(x_{t+1}\). The same process
repeats every iteration, which is why difference equations written in
this form are called \emph{iterated maps}.

Computers are naturally suited for precise, repetitive operations. In
our first example of a computational algorithm, we will iterate a given
function to produce a sequence of values of the dependent variable
\(x\). We only need two things: to specify a computer function \(f(x)\),
which returns the value of the iterated map for any input value \(x\),
and the initial value \(x_0\). Then it is a matter of repeating the
operation of evaluating \(f(x_t)\) and storing it as the next value
\(x_{t+1}\). Below is the pseudocode for the algorithm. Note that I will
use arrows to indicated variable assignment, square brackets \([]\) for
indexing of vector, and start indexing at 0, consistent with python
convention.

The resulting sequence of values \(x_0, x_1, x_2, ... , x_N\) is called
a \emph{numeric solution} of the given difference equation. It has two
disadvantages compared to an analytic solution: first, the solution can
only be obtained for a specific initial value and number of iterations,
and second, any computer simulation inevitably introduces some errors,
for instance from round-off. In practice, however, most complex
dynamical systems have to solved numerically, as analytical solutions
are difficult or impossible to find.

Their solutions, as those of nonlinear ODEs, exhibit much more
interesting behaviors than the exponential solutions of linear
equations, and are typically not solvable analytically. There may be
multiple fixed points, some stable and others unstable, and even crazier
behaviors are possible that are not permitted in smooth-flowing ODEs.
Specifically, we will see solutions that oscillate, and those that
behave without any pattern at all, that are called chaotic. You will

\begin{itemize}
\item
  build the logistic population model
\item
  find equilibrium values of nonlinear discrete-time models
\item
  analyze the stability of equilibria based on the graph of the updating

\section{Logistic population model}\label{logistic-population-model}}

Linear population growth models assume that the per capita birth and
death rates are constant, that is, they stay the same regardless of
population size. The solutions for these models either grow or decay
exponentially, but in reality, populations cannot grow without bounds.
It is generally true that the larger a population grows, the more scarce
the resources, and survival becomes more difficult. For larger
populations, this could lead to higher death rates, or lower birth
rates, or both.

To incorporate this effect into a quantitative model we will assume
there are separate birth and death rates, and that the birth rate
declines as the population grows, while the death rate increases:

b =  b_1 - b_2 N(t) ; \;   d = d_1 + d_2 N(t)
\]

To model the rate of change of the population, we need to multiply the
rates \(b\) and \(d\) by the population size \(N\), since each
individual can reproduce or die. Also, since the death rate \(d\)
decreases the population, we need to put a negative sign on it. The
resulting model is:

\[
N(t+1) - N(t) = (b -d)N(t) = [(b_1 - d_1) - (b_2 + d_2)N(t)] N(t)
\]

A simpler way of writing this equation is to let \(r = 1 + b_1 - d_1\)
and \(K = b_2 + d_2\), leading to the following iterated map:

\[
N(t+1) = (r - K N(t)) N(t)
\] (discr-log)

This is called the \emph{logistic model} of population growth. As you
see, it has two different parameters, \(r\) and \(K\). If \(K = 0\), the
equation reduces to the old linear population model. Intuitively, \(K\)
is the parameter describing the effect of increasing population on the
population growth rate. Let us analyze the dimensions of the two
parameters, by writing down the dimensions of the variables of the
difference equation. The dimensional equation is:

\[
N(t+1) = [population]= [r- K N(t)] N(t) =
= ([r]  - [K] \times [population]) \times [population]
\]

Matching the dimensions on the two sides of the equation leads us to
conclude that the dimensions of \(r\) and \(k\) are different:

\[
[r] = 1 ; \; [K] =  \frac{1}{[population]}
\]

The difference equation for the logistic model is \emph{nonlinear},
because it includes a second power of the dependent variable. In
general, it is difficult to solve nonlinear equations, but we can still
say a lot about this model's behavior without knowing its explicit
solution.

\hypertarget{fixed-points-or-equilibria}{%
\subsection{fixed points or
equilibria}\label{fixed-points-or-equilibria}}

We have seen that the solutions of difference equations depend on the
initial value of the dependent variable. In the examples we have seen so
far, the long-term behavior of the solution does not depend dramatically
on the initial condition. In more complex systems that we will
encounter, there are special values of the dependent variable for which
the dynamical system is constant, like in the pile of rocks model.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, leftrule=.75mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, breakable, opacityback=0, colback=white, toprule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomtitle=1mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, rightrule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Definition}]
For a difference equation in recurrent form \(x(t+1) = f(X(t))\), a
point \(x^*\) which satisfies \(f(x^*)=x^*\) is called a \emph{fixed
point} or \emph{equilibrium}. If the initial condition is a fixed point,
\(x_0=x^*\), the solution will stay at the same value for all time,
\(x(t)=x^*\).
\end{tcolorbox}

The reason these special points are also known as equilibria is due to
the precise balance between growth and decay that is mandated at a fixed
point. In terms of population modeling, at an equilibrium the birth
rates and the death rates are equal. Speaking analytically, in order to
find the fixed points of a difference equation, one must solve the
equation \(f(x^*) = x^*\). It may have none, or one, or many solutions.

\textbf{Example.} The linear population models which we analyzed in the
previous sections have the mathematical form \(N(t+1)= r N(t)\) (where
\(r\) can be any real number). Then the only fixed point of those models
is \(N^* = 0\), that is, a population with no individuals. If there are
any individuals present, we know that the population will grow to
infinity if \(|r| > 1\), and decay to 0 if \(|r| < 1\). This is true
even for the smallest population size, as long as it is not exactly
zero.

\textbf{Example.} Let us go back to the example of a linear difference
equation with a constant term. The equation is \$ N(t+1) = -0.5N(t)
+10\$, and we saw that the numerical solutions all converged to the same
value, regardless of the initial value. Let us find the equilibrium
value of this model using the definition:

\[
N^* = -0.5N^* +10 \Rightarrow 1.5 N^* = 10  \Rightarrow N^* = 10/1.5 = 20/3
\]

If the initial value is equal to the equilibrium, \(N(0)= 20/3\), then
the solution will remain constant for all time, since the next value
\(N(t+1) = -0.5*20/3+10 = 20/3\) remains the same.

\textbf{Example: discrete logistic model.} Let us use the simplified
version of the logistic equation \(N(t+1) = r(1 - N(t)) N(t)\) and set
the right-hand side function equal to the variable \(N\) to find the
fixed points \(N^*\): \[r(1 - N^*) N^* = N^*\] There are two solutions
to this equation, \(N^* = 0\) and \(N^* = (r-1)/r\). These are the fixed
points or the equilibrium population sizes for the model, the first
being the obvious case when the population is extinct. The second
equilibrium is more interesting, as it describes the \emph{carrying
capacity} of a population in a particular environment. If the initial
value is equal to either of the two fixed points, the solution will
remain at that same value for all time. But what happens to solutions
which do not start a fixed point? Do they converge to a fixed point, and
if so, to which one?

\hypertarget{stability-criteria-for-fixed-points}{%
\subsection{stability criteria for fixed
points}\label{stability-criteria-for-fixed-points}}

What happens to the solution of a dynamical system if the initial
condition is very close to an equilibrium, but not precisely at it? Put
another way, what happens if the equilibrium is \emph{perturbed}? To
answer the question, we will no longer confine ourselves to the
integers, to be interpreted as population sizes. We will instead
consider, abstractly, what happens if the smallest perturbation is added
to a fixed point. Will the solution tend to return to the fixed point or
tend to move away from it? The answer to this question is formalized in
the following definition (\textbf{strogatz\_nonlinear\_2001?}):

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, leftrule=.75mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, breakable, opacityback=0, colback=white, toprule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomtitle=1mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, rightrule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Definition}]
For a difference equation \(x(t+1) = f(x(t))\), a fixed point \(x^*\) is
\emph{stable} if for a sufficiently small number \(\epsilon\), the
solution \(x(t)\) with the initial condition \(x_0 = x^* + \epsilon\)
approaches the fixed point \(x^*\) as \(t \rightarrow \infty\). If the
solution \(x(t)\) does not approach \(x^*\) for any nonzero
\(\epsilon\), the fixed point is called \emph{unstable}.
\end{tcolorbox}

The notion of stability is central to the study of dynamical systems.
Typically, models more complex than those we have seen cannot be solved
analytically. Finding the fixed points and determining their stability
can help us understand the general behavior of solutions without writing
them down. For instance, we know that solutions never approach an
unstable fixed point, whereas for a stable fixed point the solutions
will tend to it, from some range of initial conditions.

There is a mathematical test to determine the stability of a fixed
point. From standard calculus comes the Taylor expansion, which
approximates the value of a function near a given point. Take a general
difference equation written in terms of some function
\(x(t+1) = f(x(t))\). Let us define the \emph{deviation} from the fixed
point \(x^*\) at time \(t\) to be \(\epsilon(t) = x_{t} - x^*\). Then we
can use the linear (first-order) Taylor approximation at the fixed point
and write down the following expression:

\[ 
x(t+1) = f(x^*) + \epsilon(t) f'(x^*) + ...
\]

The ellipsis means that the expression is approximate, with terms of
order \(\epsilon(t)^2\) and higher swept under the rug. Since we take
\(\epsilon(t)\) to be small, those terms are very small and can be
neglected. Since \(x^*\) is a fixed point, \(f(x^*) = x^*\). Thus, we
can write the following difference equation to describe the behavior of
the deviation from the fixed point \(X^*\):

\[
x(t+1) -  x^* =  \epsilon(t+1)= \epsilon(t) f'(x^*)
\]

We see that we started out with a general function defining the
difference equation and transformed it into a linear equation for the
deviation \(\epsilon(t)\). Note that the multiplicative constant here is
the derivative of the function at the fixed point: \(f'(x^*)\). This is
called the \emph{linearization} approach, which is an approximation of a
dynamical system near a fixed point with a linear equation for the small
perturbation.

We found the solution to simple linear equations, which we can use
describe the behavior of the perturbation to the fixed point. The
behavior \textbf{depends on the value of the derivative of the updating
function} \(f'(X^*)\):

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, leftrule=.75mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, breakable, opacityback=0, colback=white, toprule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomtitle=1mm, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, rightrule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, title={Important Fact}]

For a difference equation \(x(t+1) = f(x(t))\), a fixed point \(x^*\)
can be classified as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(|f'(x^*)| > 1\): the deviation \(\epsilon(t)\) grows, and the
  solution moves away from the fixed point; fixed point is
  \emph{unstable}
\item
  \(|f'(x^*)| < 1\): the deviation \(\epsilon(t)\) decays, and the
  solution approaches the fixed point; fixed point is \emph{stable}
\item
  \$\textbar f'(x\^{}*)\textbar{} = 1 \$: the fixed point may be stable
  or unstable, and more information is needed
\end{itemize}

\end{tcolorbox}

We now know how to determine the stability of a fixed point, so let us
apply this method to some examples.

\textbf{Example: linear difference equations.} Let us analyze the
stability of the fixed point of a linear difference equation, e.g. \$
N(t+1) = -0.5N(t) +10\$. The derivative of the updating function is
equal to -0.5. Because it is less than 1 in absolute value, the fixed
point is stable, so solutions converge to this equilibrium. We can state
more generally that any linear difference equation of the form
\(N(t+1) = aN(t) + b\) has one fixed point, which is equal to
\(N^* = b/(1-a)\). This fixed point is stable if \(|a| <1\) and unstable
if \(|a|>1\).

\textbf{Example: discrete logistic model.} In the last subsection we
found the fixed points of the simplified logistic model. To determine
what happens to the solution, we need to determine the stability of both
equilibria. Since the stability of fixed points is determined by the
derivative of the defining function at the fixed points, we compute the
derivative of \(f(N) = rN-rN^2\) to be \(f'(N) = r-2rN\), and evaluate
it at the two fixed points \(N^* = 0\) and \(N^* = (r-1)/r\):

\[
f'(0) = r; \; \; f'((r-1)/r) = r-2(r-1) = 2-r
\]

Because the intrinsic death rate cannot be greater than the birth rate,
we know that \(r>0\). Therefore, we have the following \emph{stability
conditions} for the two fixed points:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  the fixed point \(N^*=0\) is stable for \(r<1\), and unstable for
  \(r>1\);
\item
  the fixed point \(N^*= (r-1)/r\) is stable for \(1<r<3\), and unstable
  otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{analysis-of-logistic-population-model}{%
\section{Analysis of logistic population
model}\label{analysis-of-logistic-population-model}}

\hypertarget{rescaling-the-logistic-model}{%
\subsection{rescaling the logistic
model}\label{rescaling-the-logistic-model}}

First, let us do one more modification of the model, by taking the
parameter \(r\) as the common multiple:

\[
N_{t+1} = r(1 - \frac{K}{r} N_t) N_t
\]

As we saw, the parameter \(K\) has dimension of inverse population size,
and that the parameter \(r\) is dimensionless. We can now use rescaling
of the variable \(N\) to simplify the logistic model. The goal is to
reduce the number of parameters, by canceling some, and bringing the
rest into one place, where they can be combined into a
\emph{dimensionless group}. Here is how this is accomplished for this
model:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Pick a number of the same dimension as the variable, called the scale,
  and divide the variable by it. In this case, let the scale for
  population be \(r/K\), so then the new variable is
\end{enumerate}

\[
\tilde N = \frac{NK}{r}  \Longrightarrow N = \frac{\tilde N r}{ K }
\]

Since the parameter \(K\) has dimension of inverse population size,
\(NK\) is in the dimensionless variable \(\tilde N\).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Substitute \(\tilde N / K\) for \(N\) in the equation:
\end{enumerate}

\[
\frac{\tilde N_{t+1}r }{ K} = r\left(1  -\frac{ K \tilde N_t  r}{rK} \right) \frac{\tilde N_t r} {K}
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Canceling all the parameters on both sides, we just have the
  dimensionless growth rate \(r\), as our only parameter:
\end{enumerate}

\[
\tilde N_{t+1}  = r(1 -\tilde N_t)\tilde N_t
\]

On the surface, we merely used algebraic trickery to simplify the
equation, but the result is actually rather deep. By changing the
dimension of measurement of the population from individuals (\(N\)) to
the dimensionless fraction of the carrying capacity (\(\tilde N\)) we
found that there is only one parameter \(r\) that governs the behavior
of this model. We will see in the next two section that varying this
parameter leads to dramatic changes in the dynamics of the model
population. (\textbf{edelstein-keshet\_mathematical\_2005?})

\hypertarget{fixed-point-analysis}{%
\subsection{fixed point analysis}\label{fixed-point-analysis}}

The first step for qualitative analysis of a nonlinear model is to find
the fixed points. We use the dimensionless version of the logistic
equation, and the right-hand side function equal to the value of the
special values \(N^*\) (fixed points):

\[
r(1 - N^*) N^* = N^*
\]

There are two solutions to this equation, \(N^* = 0\) and
\(N^* = (r-1)/r\). These are the fixed points or the equilibrium
population sizes for the model, the first being the obvious case when
the population is extinct. The second equilibrium is more interesting,
as it describes the \emph{carrying capacity} of a population in a
particular environment. To determine what happens to the solution, we
need to evaluate the stability of both equilibria.

We have seen in the analytical section that the stability of fixed
points is determined by the derivative of the defining function at the
fixed points. The derivative of \(f(N) = rN-rN^2\) is \(f'(N) = r-2rN\),
and we evaluate it at the two fixed points:

\[
f'(0) = r; \; \; f'((r-1)/r) = r-2(r-1) = 2-r
\]

Because the intrinsic death rate cannot be greater than the birth rate,
we know that \(r>0\). Therefore, we have the following stability
conditions for the two fixed points:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  the fixed point \(N^*=0\) is stable for \(r<1\), and unstable for
  \(r>1\);
\item
  the fixed point \(N^*= (r-1)/r\) is stable for \(1<r<3\), and unstable
  otherwise.
\end{itemize}

We can plot the solution for the population size of the logistic model
population over time. We see that, depending on the value of the
parameter \(r\) (but not on \(k\)), the behavior is dramatically
different:

\textbf{Case 1: \(r < 1\).} The fixed point at \(N^*= 0\) is stable and
the fixed point is unstable \(N^* = (r-1)/r\). The solution tends to 0,
or extinction, regardless of the initial condition, which is illustrated
in figure {[}fig:sol\_logistic\_2{]} for \(r=0.8\).

\textbf{Case 2: \(1 < r < 3\).} The extinction fixed point \(N^*= 0\) is
unstable, but the carrying capacity fixed point \(N^* = (r-1)/r\) is
stable. We can conclude that the solution will approach the carrying
capacity for most initial conditions. This was shown in figure
{[}fig:sol\_logistic\_1{]} for \(r=1.5\) and is illustrated in figure
{[}fig:sol\_logistic\_3{]} for \(r=2.8\). Notice that although the
solution approaches the carrying capacity equilibrium in both cases,
when \(r>2\), the solution oscillates while converging to its asymptotic
value, foreshadowing the behavior when \(r>3\).

\textbf{Case 3: \$ r \textgreater{} 3\$.} Strange things happen: there
are no stable fixed points, so there is no value for the solution to
approach. As we saw in the previous section, the solution can undergo
so-called period two oscillations, which are shown in figure
{[}fig:sol\_logistic\_4{]} with \(r=3.3\). However, even stranger
behavior is observed when the parameter \(r\) crosses the threshold of
about \(3.59\). Figure {[}fig:sol\_logistic\_5{]} shows the behavior of
the solution for \(r=3.6\), which is no longer periodic, and instead
seems to bounce around without any discernible pattern. This dynamics is
known as \emph{chaos}.

\chapter{Graphical analysis of difference
equations}\label{graphical-analysis-of-difference-equations}}

In addition to calculating numeric solutions, computers can be used to
perform \emph{graphical analysis} of discrete time models. A lot of
information can be gleaned by plotting the graph of the updating
function of an recurrent difference equation \(x_{t+1} = f(x_t)\). Here
is a summary of what we can learn from the graph of the function
\(f(x)\):

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, leftrule=.75mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, breakable, opacityback=0, colback=white, toprule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomtitle=1mm, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, rightrule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, title={Graph of the updating function}]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The location of the fixed points of the iterated map. Since the
  condition for a fixed point is \(f(x) = x\), they can be found at the
  intersections of the graph of \(y=f(x)\) and \(y=x\) (the identity
  straight line).
\item
  The stability of fixed points. We learned that the derivative of
  \(f(x)\) at a fixed point determines its stability. Graphically, this
  means that the slope of \(f(x)\) at the point of intersection with
  \(y=x\) can be used for this purpose; if it is steeper (in absolute
  value) than the straight line \(y=x\), then the fixed point is
  unstable, but if its slope is less than one in absolute value, the
  equilibrium is stable.
\item
  Graphical iteration of the difference equation. The value of the
  function \(f(x)\) gives the value of \(x\) at the next time step, and
  this fact can be used to produce a graph of successive values of the
  dependent variable: \(x_0, x_1, x_2, ...\)
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

Below we will demonstrate how to plot the updating function in Python
and how to peform this analysis.

\hypertarget{plot-of-the-updating-function}{%

function}\label{plot-of-the-updating-function}}

Let us consider a linear discrete-time model:

\[
x_{t+1} = 5x_t - 10
\]

Instead of iterating this equation starting from a particular initial
value to produce a sequence of values, we will plot the function
\(f(x) = 0.5 x - 10\) and use it to predict how solutions behave
starting from \emph{any} initial value. To do this, we will plot this
function over a range of x values, along the the line \(y=x\).

it is stable or unstable? And how will solutions behave?

\hypertarget{cobweb-plot}{%
\subsection{cobweb plot}\label{cobweb-plot}}

Let us exploit the idea in the third point for graphical analysis of an
iterated map. Starting with some initial condition \(x_0\), the value of
\(x_1\) is given by \(f(x_0)\). To show this graphically, starting the
point \(x_0\) on the axis, draw a vertical line to \(y=f(x_0)\). Next,
draw a horizontal line to the graph of \(y=x\). Since the \(y\) and
\(x\) coordinates are equal, we now have the value of \(x_1 = f(x_0)\)
as the x coordinate. Then, repeat the process by drawing a vertical line
to \(y=f(x_1)\), and the a horizontal line \(y=x\), etc. The resulting
sequence of x coordinates is a quick way of assessing the dynamics of
the iterated map. For instance, the values may converge to a fixed
point, or grow to infinity, or bounce around without settling down. The
resulting graph of alternating vertical and horizontal line segments is
called a cobweb plot:

You can see that the solution, shown in green, start from initial value
of -3 and steps upward toward the fixed point at 2. You can experiment
by trying a different initial value, say 10 (you will have to change the
domain of the plotted function) but you should still observe convergence
to the fixed point at 2.

This could be predicted from the analysis performed in the previous
section: the slope of the updating function is 0.5 (everywhere, since
it's a straight line) and since that is less than 1 in absolute value,
the fixed point is stable, and solutions are expected to converge to it.

We now have at our disposal analytical, numerical, and graphical tools
to analyze and predict the behavior of a dynamical system. In the next
section we will use all three to analyze a more complex model of
population growth.

\hypertarget{graphical-analysis-of-the-logistic-model}{%
\section{Graphical analysis of the logistic
model}\label{graphical-analysis-of-the-logistic-model}}

As we saw, we can learn a lot about the behavior of a dynamical system
from analyzing the graph of the defining function. Let us consider two
quadratic functions for the logistic model: \(f(N) = 2N(1-N/2)\) and
\(f(N) = 4N(1-N/4)\) .

First, plotting the graphs of \(y=f(N)\) and \(y=N\), allows us to find
the fixed points of the logistic model. Since it is a , we see that
there are fixed points at \(N = 0\) for both functions, and carrying
capacity sizes at \(N=2\) and \(N=3\), respectively. The reader should
check that this is in agreement with the analytic prediction of
\(N^* = (r-1)/r\).

Second, we can obtain information about stability of the two fixed
points by considering the slope of the curve \(y=f(N)\) at the points
where it crosses \(y=N\). On the graph of the first function, the slope
is clearly 0, which indicates that the fixed point is stable, in
agreement with the analytical prediction. On the graph of the second
function, the slope is negative and steeper than -1. This indicates that
the fixed point is unstable, again consistent with our analysis above.

Third, we graph a few iterations of the cobweb plot to obtain an idea
about the dynamics of the population over time. As expected, for the
first function with \(r=2\), the solution quickly approaches the
carrying capacity (\{numref. In the second function, however, \(r = 4\)
and the carrying capacity is unstable. In \{numref\}\texttt{fig-cobweb2}
we observe a wild pattern of jumps that never approach any particular
value.

We have seen how graphical tools can be used to analyze and predict the
behavior of a dynamical system. In the case of the logistic model, we
never found the analytic solution, because it frequently does not exist
as a formula. Finding the fixed points and analyzing their stability, in
conjunction with looking at the behavior of a cobweb plot, allowed us to
describe the dynamics of population growth in the logistic model,
without doing any ``mathematics''. Together, the analytical and
graphical analysis provide complementary tools for biological modelers.

\hypertarget{chaos-in-discrete-dynamical-systems}{%
\subsection{chaos in discrete dynamical
systems}\label{chaos-in-discrete-dynamical-systems}}

In this chapter we learned to analyze the dynamics of solutions of
nonlinear discrete-time dynamical systems without solving them on paper.
In the last two sections we focused on the logistic difference equation
as a simple nonlinear model with a rich array of dynamic behaviors. In
this section we will summarize the analysis and draw conclusions for
difference equation models in biology. This behavior was brought to the
attention of biologists by John Maynard Smith
(\textbf{smith\_mathematical\_1968?}) and Robert May
(\textbf{may\_bifurcations\_1976?}).

Why does the logistic model behave so strangely in the second example
above? We can use numerical simulations to plot the long-term solutions
for the dependent variable for a range of parameter values, let us say
between \(2.5 < r < 4\). Then we plot the values to which the simulation
converged (whether it is one, two, or many) on the y-axis, and the value
of the parameter \(r\) on the x-axis. The resulting \emph{bifurcation
diagram} in shown in \{numref\}\texttt{fig-log-bifur}. The value of the
parameter \(r\) is plotted on the horizontal axis, and the set of values
that the dependent variable takes in the long run is shown on the
vertical axis. There is only one stable fixed point for \(r<3\), then we
see a 2-cycle appear for \(3<r<3.45\). For values of \(r\) greater than
about 3.45, a series of period-doubling bifurcations occur with shorter
and shorter intervals of \(r\). This is called a \emph{period-doubling
cascade}, which culminates at the value of \(r \approx 3.57\), where the
number of points in the cycle becomes essentially infinite. The sequence
of values of \(r\) at which period-doubling occurs is approximately:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  period 2; \(r_1 = 3\)
\item
  period 4; \(r_2 \approx 3.449\)
\item
  period 8; \(r_3 \approx 3.544\)
\item
  period 16; \(r_4 \approx 3.564\)
\item
  period 32; \(r_5 \approx 3.569\)
\item
  period \(\infty\) (chaos); \(r_\infty \approx 3.570\)
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}


For $r > r_\infty$, we observe a remarkable behavior found only in nonlinear dynamical systems, called *chaos*. Chaos is characterized by two qualities:

:::{.callout-note icon=false} 

## Characteristics of chaos

1.  **Aperiodic behavior**: the dependent variable never repeats a value exactly, instead bouncing around an infinite set of values for all time

2.  **Sensitive dependence on initial conditions**: no matter how close two initial conditions in a chaotic system, given enough time the two trajectories will diverge and lose any resemblance
:::

What is especially surprising about chaos is that for a given initial condition a chaotic model gives a completely predictable and reproducible sequence of values of the dependent variable. However, given finite machine precision, or any error in initial conditions, a chaotic system is practically unpredictable and irreproducible. But there is a fundamental difference between deterministic chaos and a stochastic system, e.g. the model of coin tosses where knowing the previous result of the coin flip does not allow us to predict the next result, even under ideal conditions.

Notice in figure , that for $r > r_\infty$, chaotic behavior is observed only for some values of $r$. As you can see in figure , there are “bands of periodicity”, where the attractor is a  sequence of $n$ numbers (and periods of 3,5, etc. are observed), alternating with bands of chaos. This illustrates that even the simplest nonlinear discrete dynamical systems can have incredibly complex behavior. When these results were first published by May in the 1970s, they revolutionized both the mathematical understanding of dynamical systems, and the field of theoretical biology. In one-variable dynamic systens, chaos occurs only in discrete-time dynamical models, but for three or more variables continuous time (ODE) dynamical systems also can behavechaotically.

As a mathematical side-note, if one looks at the differences between successive values of $r_n$, they behave like a geometric sequence, getting smaller and smaller by a constant fraction:




$$
\delta_n = \frac{r_{n}-r_{n-1}}{r_{n+1}-r_{n}}
$$




It is a remarkable fact that $\delta_n$ approaches a constant value when $n$ gets large, $4.6692...$, known as the Feigenbaum constant. It can be proven that this constant is the same for other iterated maps with the same shape as the downward parabola of the logistic map (e.g. $f(x) = \sin(x)$). Explaining why this deep mathematical fact is true is far outside the bounds of this course. [@strogatz_nonlinear_2001]

Chaos was a popular topic back in the 1980s and 90s, and even inspired popular books [@gleick_chaos:_1988]. It is in fact remarkable that very simple difference equations can have solutions of apparently great complexity. This is intriguing because it appeals to a fairly universal human desire for simple explanations for complicated phenomena. The popular exposure to what was dubbed “chaos theory” (which is not an actual mathematical topic) spawned some inaccurate cliches, such as “a butterfly flapping its wings in South America can cause a hurricane to form and hit Florida”. The image refers to the phenomenon of sensitive dependence on initial conditions, but of course it is utterly ridiculous to draw a causal arrow between a butterfly (one of an enumerable number of things changing the “initial conditions”) and large-scale atmospheric phenomena. While there is some evidence that weather patters are complex systems that exhibit chaotic behavior, we lack the ability to isolate and control all influences that may perturb it, so pinning it on a butterfly is pretty unfair.

Despite the initial flurry of excitement, so-called chaos theory has failed to make a big impact on our understanding of complex biological systems. Although it is still quite fascinating intellectually, a simple model like the logistic model is not an adequate model for any realistic population, particularly for large values of $r$ where the chaotic behavior occurs. We now appreciate that the essential complexity of biological system requires multiple interacting variables which cannot be reduced to a single equation. However, there has been some successful observation of chaotic behavior in a population of flour beetles, which seemed to agree with predictions of a three-variable difference equation model [@costantino_chaotic_1997].

We have seen how graphical tools can be used to analyze and predict the behavior of a discrete-time dynamical system. We investigated the logistic model by finding the fixed points and analyzing their stability. Together with analysis of the graph of the updating function and making a cobweb plot, this allowed us to describe the dynamics of population growth in the logistic model, without doing any “math”. Together, analytical and graphical analysis provide powerful tools for biological modelers.

\chapter{Discrete models of higher
order}\label{discrete-models-of-higher-order}}

It is not unusual for biological systems to have multiple variables
which influence each other, and thus need to be accounted in any model
that aims to be useful. In this unit we will learn how to construct such
models, and the methods for analyzing, solving, and numerically
simulating them. We will see how models with two or more variables are
used in a variety of biological fields: to describe population
demographics, motility of cochlear cells, psychology of human
relationships, gene regulation, and motion of molecular structures.

We will need new mathematical tools in order to analyze models with
multiple variables. These methods are primarily from the realm of linear
algebra. We will express multiple equations in terms of matrices and
vectors, and learn how to operate on these objects. The dynamics of
these models can be analyzed by doing calculations with the matrices,
specifically finding special numbers and vectors known as eigenvalues
and eigenvectors. These concepts, which will be introduced later, are
absolutely central to all of applied mathematics, and to computational
biology in particular.

In this chapter, the section on modeling is devoted to an old model of a
population where individuals live for two generations, known as the
Fibonacci model. We then describe how this model can be written down
either as a single difference equation of second order, or as two
equation of the first order, which may be represented in matrix form. We
will learn to solve second order difference equations with an explicit
formula, and then introduce some elementary matrix operations. In the
computational section we will use the matrix notation to compute
numerical solutions for higher order difference equations. Finally, in
the synthesis section we will analyze two demographic population models,
in which the population is broken into age groups. The matrix notation
will be important for concisely representing different parameters for
each age group.

In this chapter you will learn to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  build higher order population models
\item
  express age-structured models in matrix form
\item
  analyze solutions of these models on paper
\item
  use Python for matrix operations
\item
  classify the behavior of solutions of these models
\end{itemize}

\section{higher order difference
equations}\label{higher-order-difference-equations}}

So far we have dealt with difference equations in which the value of the
dependent variable at the next time step \(x_{t+1}\) depends solely on
the variable at the present time \(x_t\). These are known as \emph{first
order} difference equations because they only require one step from the
present to the future. We will now examine difference equations where
the future value depends not only on the present value \(x_t\), but also
on the past values: \(x_{t-1}\), etc. The number of time steps that the
equation looks into the past is the the order of the scheme.

\hypertarget{the-fibonacci-model-and-sequence}{%
\subsection{the Fibonacci model and
sequence}\label{the-fibonacci-model-and-sequence}}

The Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci, who lived in the late 12th
- early 13th centuries, contributed greatly to the development of
mathematics in the western world. For starters, he introduced the
Hindu-Arabic numerals we use today, in place of the cumbersome Roman
numerals. He also constructed an early model of population growth, which
considered a population of individuals that lived for two generations.
The first generation does not reproduce, but in the second generation
each individual produces a single offspring (or each pair produces a new
pair) and then dies. Then the total number of individuals at the next
time step is the sum of the individuals in the previous two time steps
(\{numref\}\texttt{fig-fib-rabbits}) This is described by the following
second order difference equation:

\[
N_{t+1} = N_t + N_{t-1}
\] (fibonacci)

The famous Fibonacci sequence is a solution of this equation. For a
second-order equations, two initial conditions are required, and if we
take \(N_0 = 0\) and \(N_1 = 1\), then the resulting sequence will look
as follows:

\[
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...

The Fibonacci sequence is famously found in many natural phenomena,
including in phyllotaxis (arrangement of parts in plants), and spirals
on some mollusk shells, e.g.~\emph{Nautilus pompilius}
(\{numref\}\texttt{fig-fib-rabbits}). It may be observed by counting the
number of spirals that can be drawn between plant units (such as seeds
or petals), and observing that alternating the right-handed and
left-handed spirals, while moving away from the center, often results in
the Fibonacci sequence. The precise reason for this is unclear, although
explanations exist, for instance that this pattern provides the most
efficient packing of seeds.

\subsection{matrix representation of discrete time
models}\label{matrix-representation-of-discrete-time-models}}

The Fibonacci model above can be represented by two equations instead of
one, if we consider two dependent variables. Let us represent the number
of rabbits in generation 1 (young) by \(x\) and in generation 2 (old)
by\(y\). The new generation at the next time (\(t+1\)) is comprised of
offspring of the young and old generations at time \(t\), while the old
generation at the next time is simply is young generation at the current
time. This gives the following set of equations:

\[\begin{aligned}
 x_{t+1} & = & x_t + x_{t-1}\\
 x_{t} & = & x_t\end{aligned}
\]

The advantage of re-writing a single equation as two is that the new
system is first order, that is, only relies on the values of the
variables at the current time \(t\). These equations can also be written
in \emph{matrix} form:

\[
\left(\begin{array}{c}x_{t+1} \\x_{t}\end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{c}x_t + x_{t-1} \\x_ t \end{array}\right) =   \left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 1\\1 & 0\end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{c}x_t \\ x_{t-1} \end{array}\right)
\]

This representation is convenient and leads to a set of rules for matrix
manipulation. We wrote the write-hand side as a product of a matrix
containing the coefficients of \(x_t\) and \(y_t\) and the vector with
the two variables. The product of the matrix and the vector is equal to
the original vector.

\subsection{solutions of linear difference
equations}\label{solutions-of-linear-difference-equations}}

Solutions for first order linear difference equations are exponential in
form. The solutions for second order linear difference equations consist
of a sum of two exponentials with different bases. For the following
general linear second order difference equation:

\[
x_{t+1} = ax_{t} + b x_{t-1}
\]

The solution can be written as follows:

\[
x_t  = A \lambda_1^t + B \lambda_2^t
\]

The solution for a second order difference equation is a sum of two
terms that look like solutions to first order difference equations.
There are two different types of constants in the solution: the bases of
the exponential \(\lambda_1, \lambda_2\) and the multiplicative
constants \(A\) and \(B\). They are different because the exponential
parameters depend on the equation itself, but not on the initial
conditions, while the multiplicative constants depend only on the
initial conditions. Therefore, they can be determined separately:

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, leftrule=.75mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, breakable, opacityback=0, colback=white, toprule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomtitle=1mm, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, rightrule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, title={Outline for solving a second order linear difference equation}]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Substitute the solution \(x_t = \lambda^t\) into the difference
  equation. For the general difference equation, we obtain a the
  following quadratic relation by dividing everything by
  \(\lambda^{t-1}\):
\end{enumerate}

\[
\lambda^{t+1} = a \lambda^{t} + b \lambda^{t-1} \Rightarrow \lambda^2 = a\lambda + b
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Solve the quadratic equation for values of \(\lambda\) which satisfy
  the difference equation:
\end{enumerate}

\[
\lambda_{1,2} = \frac{a \pm \sqrt {a^2  + 4b} }{2}
\]

If \(a^2 + 4b > 0\), this gives two values of \(\lambda\); if
\(a^2 + 4b = 0\), there is a single value, and if \(a^2 + 4b < 0\), then
no real values of \(\lambda\) satisfy the difference equation.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Once we have found the values \(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\), use the
  initial conditions (e.g.~some values \(x_0\) and \(x_1\)) to solve for
  the multiplicative constants:
\end{enumerate}

\[
x_0 = A + B ; \; x_1 = A\lambda_1 + B\lambda_2
\]

Use \(A = x_0 - B\) to plug into the second equation:
\(x_1 = (x_0 - B) \lambda_1 + B \lambda_2\)

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  The general solution for \(A\) and \(B\) is the following, provided
  \(\lambda_2 \neq \lambda_1\):
\end{enumerate}

\[
B = \frac{x_1 -x_0 \lambda_1}{\lambda_2 - \lambda_1}; \; A =  \frac{x_0\lambda_2 - x_1}{\lambda_2 - \lambda_1}
\]

\end{tcolorbox}

Let us apply this approach to solving the Fibonacci difference equation
\{eq\}\texttt{fibonacci}:

\[
\lambda^{2}= \lambda + 1 \Longrightarrow \;  \lambda^2-\lambda-1= 0
\]

We find the solutions by the quadratic formula:
\(\lambda_{1,2} = (1\pm \sqrt 5)/2\).

Now let us use the initial conditions \(N_0 = 0\) and \(N_1 = 1\). The
two multiplicative constants must then satisfy the following:

\[
0 = A + B; \; 1 = A\lambda_1 + B\lambda_2
\]

By the formula we found above, the initial conditions are:

\[
A =  \frac{-1}{\lambda_2 - \lambda_1} =  \frac{1}{\sqrt 5} ; \; B = \frac{1}{\lambda_2 - \lambda_1} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt 5}
\]

The complete solution, which gives the \(t\)-th number in the Fibonacci
sequence is:

\[
N_t =  \frac{1}{\sqrt 5}\left( \frac{1+ \sqrt 5}{2}\right)^t - \frac{1}{\sqrt 5}\left(\frac{1- \sqrt 5}{2}\right)^t
\]

There are several remarkable things about this formula. First is the
fact that despite the abundance of irrational numbers, for each integer
\(t\) the number \(N_t\) is an integer. One can check this by
programming the formula in your favorite language, and plugging in any
value of \(t\).

Second, an important feature of the Fibonacci sequence is the ratio
between successive terms in the sequence. Notice that of the two terms
in the formula, \((\frac{1+ \sqrt 5}{2})^t\) grows as \(t\) increases,
while \((\frac{1- \sqrt 5}{2})^t\) decreases to zero, because the first
number is greater than 1, while the second is less than 1. This means
that for large \(t\), the terms in the Fibonacci sequence are
approximately equal to:

\[
N_t \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt 5}\left( \frac{1+ \sqrt 5}{2}\right)^t
\]

Since each successive term is multiplied by \((1+\sqrt5)/2\), the ratio
between successive terms, \(\phi = N_{t+1}/N_t\) approaches the value
\(\phi=(1+\sqrt5)/2 \approx 1.618\) for increasing \(t\).

This number \((1+\sqrt 5)/2\) is called the \emph{golden ratio} or
\emph{golden section}, and was known from antiquity as the most
aesthetically pleasing proportion in architecture and art, when used as
a ratio between the height and width of the piece of art. Algebraically,
the golden ratio is defined to be the number that is both the ratio
between two quantities, e.g.~\(a\) and \(b\), and also the ratio between
the sum of the two quantities (\(a+b\)) and the larger of the quantities
e.g.~\(b\) (\{numref\}\texttt{fig-gold-ratio}). Geometrically, the
golden ratio can be constructed as the ratio between two sides of a
rectangle, \(a\) and \(b\), which are also part of the larger rectangle
with sides \(a+b\) and \(a\). This construction is shown in
\{numref\}\texttt{fig-gold-rect}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{./images/golden_ratio_line.png}

\caption{Line segments that are in golden proportion to each other

{\centering \includegraphics{./images/gold_rect_const.png}

}

\caption{Construction of a rectangle with the golden ratio between its
sides \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio}}

\end{figure}

To show that the geometric golden ratio is the same as the ratio that
appears in the Fibonacci sequence, let us write down the algebraic
condition stated above. Because we are interested in the ratio, let the
smaller quantity be 1 and the larger one be \(\phi\); by the definition
we obtain the following. \(\phi = (\phi+1)/\phi\), thus
\(\phi^2-\phi-1 = 0\). This is the same quadratic equation that we
derived for the exponential bases of the solution above. The solution to
this equation (by the quadratic formula) is \(\phi=(1\pm\sqrt5)/2\), and
the positive solution is the golden ratio.

\hypertarget{elementary-matrix-operations}{%
\subsection{elementary matrix
operations}\label{elementary-matrix-operations}}

Now is a good time to properly define what matrices are and how we can
operate on them. We have already seen transition matrices, but just to
make sure all of the terms are clear:

A \emph{matrix} \(A\) is a rectangular array of \emph{elements}
\(A_{ij}\), in which \(i\) denotes the row number (index), counted from
top to bottom, and \(j\) denotes the column number (index), counted from
left to right. The \emph{dimensions} of a matrix are defined by the
number of rows and columns, so an \emph{n by m matrix} contains \(n\)
rows and \(m\) columns.

Elements of a matrix are not all created equal, they are divided into
two types:

The elements of a matrix \(A\) which have the same row and column index,
e.g.~\(A_{33}\) are called the \emph{diagonal elements}. Those which do
not lie on the diagonal are called the \emph{off-diagonal} elements.

For instance, in the 3 by 3 matrix below, the elements \(a, e, i\) are
the diagonal elements:

\[
A = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}a & b & c \\d & e & f \\g & h & i\end{array}\right)
\]

Matrices can be added together if they have the same dimensions. Then
matrix addition is defined simply as adding up corresponding elements,
for instance the element in the second row and first column of matrix
\(A\) is added with the element in the second row and first column of
matrix \(B\) to give the element in the second row and first column of
matrix \(C\). Recall from the previous chapter that rows in matrices are
counted from top to bottom, while the columns are counted left to right.

Matrices can also be multiplied, but this operation is trickier. For
mathematical reasons, multiplication of matrices \(A \times B\) does not
mean multiplying corresponding elements. Instead, the definition seeks
to capture the calculation of simultaneous equations, like the one in
the previous section. Here is the definition of matrix multiplication,
in words and in a formula (\textbf{strang\_linear\_2005?}):

The \emph{product of matrices \(A\) and \(B\)} is defined to be a matrix
\(C\), whose element \(c_{ij}\) is the \textbf{dot product of the i-th
row of \(A\) and the j-th column of \(B\)}:

\[
c_{ij} = a_{i1}b_{1j} + a_{i2}b_{2j} + ... + a_{iN}b_{Nj} = \sum_{k=1}^q a_{ik} b_{kj}
\]

This definition is possible only if the length of the rows of \(A\) and
the length of columns of \(B\) are the same, since we cannot compute the
dot product of two vectors of different lengths. Matrix multiplication
is defined only if \(A\) is \(n\) by \(q\) and \(B\) is \(q\) by \(m\),
for any integers \(n\), \(q\), and \(m\) and the resulting matrix \(C\)
is a matrix with \(n\) rows and \(m\) columns. In other words,
\textbf{the inner dimensions of matrices have to match} in order for
matrix multiplication to be possible. This is illustrated in
\{numref\}\texttt{fig-mat-mult}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{./images/matrix_multiplication_tikz.png}

}

\caption{Multiplication of two matrices \(A\) and \(B\) results in a new
matrix \(C\)}

\end{figure}

\textbf{Example.} Let us multiply two matrices to illustrate how it's
done. Here both matrices are 2 by 2, so their inner dimensions match and
the resulting matrix is 2 by 2 as well:

\[
\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 3 \\ 6 & 1\end{array}\right) \times \left(\begin{array}{cc}4 & 1 \\5 & -1 \end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{cc}1 \times 4 + 3 \times 5 & 1 \times 1 +3 \times (-1) \\ 6 \times 4+ 1 \times 5 & 6 \times 1+1 \times (-1) \end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{cc}19 & -2 \\ 29 & 5 \end{array}\right)
\]

One important consequence of this definition is that \textbf{matrix
multiplication is not commutative}. If you switch the order, e.g.
\(B \times A\), the resulting multiplication requires dot products of
the rows of \(B\) by the columns of \(A\), and except in very special
circumstances, they are not the same. In fact, unless \(m\) and \(n\)
are the same integer, the product of \(B \times A\) may not be defined
at all.

In the example above of the matrix representation of the Fibonacci
model, we implicitly used the conventional rules for multiplying
matrices and vectors. Each row of the matrix

\[
\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 1\\1 & 0\end{array}\right)
\]

contains the numbers that multiply the two elements of the vector

\[
\left(\begin{array}{c}x_t \\ x_{t-1} \end{array}\right)
\]

in order to generate the two equations \(x_{t+1} = x_t + x_{t-1}\) and
\(x_t = x_t\).

Take the matrix equation for the Fibonacci difference equation above.
Put the first two values \(0\) and \(1\) into the vector. Then perform
the multiplication of the matrix and the vector:

\[
\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 1\\1 & 0\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}1\\ 0\end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{c}0+ 1 \\ 1 \end{array}\right)  = \left(\begin{array}{c}1 \\ 1 \end{array}\right)
\]

We can take the resulting vector and apply the matrix again, to
propagate the sequence for one more step:

\[
\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 1\\1 & 0\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}1\\ 1\end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{c}1+ 1 \\ 1 \end{array}\right)  = \left(\begin{array}{c}2 \\ 1 \end{array}\right)
\]

Multiplying matrices and vectors is a basic operation that depends on
the orientation of the vector. One can only multiply a square matrix by
a column vector on the left, as we saw above, not on the right. By the
same token, a row vector can only multiply a matrix on the right, and
not the left, because we must use the \emph{rows} of the matrix on the
left to multiply the \emph{columns} of the matrix on the right. This
underscores the important fact that matrix multiplication is not
commutative.

\hypertarget{age-structured-population-models}{%
\section{Age-structured population
models}\label{age-structured-population-models}}

It is often useful to divide a population into different groups by age
in order to better describe the population dynamics. Typically,
individuals at different life stages have distinct mortality and
reproductive rates. The total population is represented as a vector,
where each component denotes the size of the corresponding age group.
The matrix \(A\) that multiplies this vector defines the dynamics of the
higher order difference equation:

\[
\vec x_{t+1} = A \vec x_t
\]

We will now analyze two common \emph{age-structured models} used by
biologists and demographers.

\hypertarget{leslie-models}{%
\subsection{Leslie models}\label{leslie-models}}

One type of age-structured model used to describe population dynamics is
called the \emph{Leslie model}
(\textbf{edelstein-keshet\_mathematical\_2005?};
\textbf{allman\_mathematical\_2003?}). In this model, there are several
different age groups, and after a single time step, individuals in each
one all either advance to the next oldest age group or die. This type of
can be described in general using the following matrix (called a Leslie
matrix):

\[
L = \left(\begin{array}{cccc}f_1 & f_2 & ... & f_n \\s_1 & 0 & ... & 0 \\... & ... &...& ... \\0 & ... & s_{n-1}& 0\end{array}\right)
\]

where \(f_i\) is the fecundity (number of offspring produced by an
individual) of the \(i\)-th age group, and \(s_i\) is the survival rate
of the \(i\)-th age group (the fraction of the group that survives and
becomes the next age group). Population of the next generation is given
by multiplying the age-structure vector of the previous generation:
\(\vec x_{t+1} = L \vec x_t\). Note that each age group proceeds
straight to the next age group (multiplied by the survival rate) but no
individuals stay in the same age group after one time step.
Biologically, this assumes a clear, synchronized maturation of every age
group in the population. Mathematically, this means that the
\emph{diagonal elements} of the matrix (those in the \(i\)-th row and
\(i\)-th column) are 0.

Let us model a hypothetical population in which there are two age
groups: a young age group which does not reproduce, with survival rate
of 0.4 to become mature, and a mature age group which reproduces with
mean fecundity of 2, and then dies. Let \(j_t\) be the population of the
juveniles at time \(t\), and \(m_t\) be the population of mature adults.
Then the following Leslie matrix describes this model:

\[
\left(\begin{array}{c}j_{t+1}\\ m_{t+1}\end{array}\right) =  \left(\begin{array}{cc}0 & 2 \\0.4 & 0\end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{c}j_{t}\\ m_{t}\end{array}\right)
\]

We can also express this model as a single difference equation, with the
variable of total population. Because it takes two time steps for a
young individual to reproduce, we need to consider the population in two
previous time steps. The matrix equation above can be written as the
following two equations:

\[
j_{t+1} = 2 m_t ; \; m_{t+1} = 0.4 j_t
\]

This two-dimensional model can be turned into a second-order model by a
simple substitution. The first equation can be written as
\(j_t = 2 m_{t-1}\), and then substitute it into second one to, to
obtain:

\[
m_{t+1} = 0.8m_{t-1}
\]

We can solve this equation using the tools from the analytical section.
First, let us find the exponential bases \(\lambda\):

\[
\lambda^2 = 0.8 \Rightarrow \lambda = \pm \sqrt{0.8}
\]

To solve the dynamical system completely, let us suppose we have the
initial conditions \(m_0\) and \(m_1\). Then we have the following
equations to solve:

\[
A + B = m_0; \; A\sqrt 0.8 - B \sqrt 0.8 = m_1\Rightarrow (m_0 - B) \sqrt 0.8 - B \sqrt 0.8 = m_1 \Rightarrow B =m_0 - \frac{m_1}{\sqrt 8}; \; A = \frac{m_1}{\sqrt 8}
\]

We have the following analytic solution of the difference equation:

\[
m_t = \frac{m_1}{\sqrt 8} \sqrt 8^t - \left(m_0 - \frac{m_1}{\sqrt 8} \right)  \sqrt 8^t = 2m_1 \sqrt 8^{t-1}  - m_0 \sqrt 8^{t}
\]

This solution can be used to predict the long-term dynamics of the
population model. Since the bases of the exponentials are less than 1,
the total number of individuals will decline to zero. This solution can
be verified via a numerical solution of this model.
\{numref\}\texttt{fig-leslie} shows the population over 20 time steps,
starting with 10 individuals both for \(m_0\) and \(m_1\).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{./images/leslie_dynamics.png}

}

\caption{A plot of the total population in the Leslie model shown above,
showing an oscillatory decay to 0}

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{usher-models}{%
\subsection{Usher models}\label{usher-models}}

Usher models are a modification of the Leslie model, where individuals
are allowed to remain in the same age group after one time step. Thus,
the form of an Usher matrix is:

\[
U = \left(\begin{array}{cccc}f_1 & f_2 & ... & f_n \\s_1 & r_2 & ... & 0 \\... & ... &...& ... \\0 & ... & s_{n-1} & r_n\end{array}\right)
\]

where \(r_i\) is the rate of remaining in the same age cohort.

For instance, it the population model above, we can introduce a rate of
adults remaining adults (rather than dead) after a time step (let it be
0.2):

\[
U =  \left(\begin{array}{cc}0 & 2 \\0.4 & 0.2\end{array}\right)
\]

\[
j_{t+1} = 2 m_t ; \; m_{t+1} = 0.4 j_t +0.2m_t
\]

Once again, we can find the solution for this model by recasting it as a
single second-order equation. Let us substitute \(2m_{t-1}\) for \(j_t\)
to obtain the following:

\[
m_{t+1} = 0.4(2 m_{t-1} )+ 0.2 m_t
\]

We can solve this second-order equation in the same fashion as above:

\[
\lambda^2 = 0.2 \lambda + 0.8 \Rightarrow \lambda = (0.2 \pm \sqrt {0.04+3.2})/2 = (0.2 \pm 1.8)/2 = 1, -0.8
\]

The two exponential bases are 1 and -0.8, and therefore the solution has
the general form \(m_t = A + B(-0.8)^t\). The behavior of the solution
over the long term is going to stabilize at some level \(A\), determined
by the initial conditions, because the term \(B(-0.8)^t\), when raised
to progressively larger powers, will decay to 0.

We can run a computer simulation to test this prediction, and see that
the total population indeed approaches a constant. Starting with
population of 10 individuals in the first two time steps, the time
course of the population is plotted in \{numref\}\texttt{fig-usher}.

\hypertarget{matrix-multiplication-and-population-models}{%
\chapter{Matrix multiplication and population
models}\label{matrix-multiplication-and-population-models}}

The solution of a difference equation can be found numerically using the
matrix and vector form we introduced above. As we saw in the Fibonacci
example, the next vector in the sequence can be obtained by multiplying
the previous vector by the defining matrix. Let \(\vec x_t\) be the
vector containing \(n\) values of the dependent variables, and \(A\) be
the defining matrix of dimension \(k\) by \(k\). The solutions are
obtained by repeated multiplication by the matrix \(A\):

\[
\vec x_{t+1} = A  \vec x_{t}
\]

We will now show how to implement this procedure in a program. For the
simulation to be run, the program must set the following required
components: the matrix defining the difference map, sufficient number of
initial values, and the number of steps desired to iterate the solution.
At each step, the current value of the vector of dependent variables is
multiplied by the matrix \(A\). In the following pseudocode I use
two-dimensional arrays with two indices (row and column), and a colon in
place of index indicates all of the elements in that dimension,
e.g.~\(x[0,:]\) indicates the entire first row of array \(x\). I assume
that programming language has an operator for multiplying matrices,
which is indicated by the multiplication symbol \(\times\).

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, leftrule=.75mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, breakable, opacityback=0, colback=white, toprule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomtitle=1mm, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, rightrule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, title={Solution of matrix discrete-time models}]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  set the number of variables \(k\)
\item
  set age-structured matrix \(A\)
\item
  set \(n\) to be the number of iterations (time steps)
\item
  set the initial condition vector \(x_0\)
\item
  initialize array \(x\) with \(n\) rows and \(n + 1\) columns
\item
  set the first column to \(x_0\)
\item
  for \(i\) from 0 to \(n - 1\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(x[:, i+1] \gets A \times x[:, i]\)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{tcolorbox}

This code produces a rectangular array \(x\) with \(k\) rows and
\(n + 1\) columns. The values of the variables at time \(j\) are stored
in the vector \(x[:,j]\). Conversely, in order to follow the dynamics of
a particular variable over time, e.g.~number \(i\), through all \(n\)
time steps, we can plot the vector \(x[:,i]\).

Let us take the Fibonacci model again in the matrix form, with the
matrix \(A\) and initial vector \(\vec x_0\) as follows:

\[
A =  \left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 1\\1 & 0\end{array}\right); \;  \vec x_0 =   \left(\begin{array}{c}1 \\1 \end{array}\right)
\]

After iterating the matrix equation for 10 time steps, we obtain the
following array \(X\), with the fist and second row representing the
population at the current and the previous time step, respectively, and
the column representing time step:

\[
\begin{array}{cccccccccc} 
 1 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 8 & 13 & 21 & 34 & 55 & 89 \\
 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 8 & 13  &  21 & 34 & 55  \\
 \end{array}

\section{Matrix models in Python}\label{matrix-models-in-python}}

In this section you will use Python's linear algebra library to compute
the characteristic polynomial, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors of the
models.

We saw in the section above that the found the eigenvalues by rewriting
the equation for \(\lambda\) as a kth order polynomial, then found its
roots. Python has a command for that, we can construct the
characteristic polynomial of a matrix using the function poly(A), where
A is a matrix. More specifically, we can find the coefficients for the
characteristic polynomial.

Consider the Leslie population model from the example above:

\[
\left(\begin{array}{c}j_{t+1}\\ m_{t+1}\end{array}\right) =  \left(\begin{array}{cc}0 & 2 \\0.4 & 0\end{array}\right) \times \left(\begin{array}{c}j_{t}\\ m_{t}\end{array}\right)
\]

where \(j_t\) is the number of juveniles after \(t\) generations and
\(m_t\) is the number of mature individuals after \(t\) generations.
Propagation of this model requires multiplication of the matrix and the
population vector. There is a special symbol in Python for this
operation:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{L}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{np.array([[}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{], [}\FloatTok{0.4}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{]]) }\CommentTok{\# define Leslie matrix}

This propagates the population by one time step only. To compute a
numeric solution of this population over a number of time steps, use a
for loop like in our last week's assignment. The only difference is that
the solution is now a two-dimensional array instead of a one-dimensional
one, with two rows for the two ages and numsteps+1 columns, and it needs
to be pre-allocated before the for loop:

The \emph{eigenvalues} of the matrix L determine the dynamics of the
population, the the \emph{eigenvectors} determine the population
structure. Python has a single function for finding eigenvalues and
eigenvectors: \texttt{np.linalg.eig()}.

\end{verbatim}

Each column of the eVecs matrix corresponds to an eigenvaluein the eVals
array (i.e.~the first column of eigenvectors corresponds to the first
element in eVals).

The largest (in absolute value) eigenvalue is the \emph{dominant
eigenvalue} and determines the long term behavior of the population. In
this example, both eigenvalues are equal in absolute value and are less
than 1, which predicts population decay.

The lack of a single dominant eigenvalue means that the population
structure (ratio of juveniles and adults) does not converge to a stable
fraction:

Why did we use the second column (index 1)? Because it corresponds to
the dominant eigenvalue 1, as you can check by looking at eVals. Notice

\chapter{Linear ODEs with two
variables}\label{linear-odes-with-two-variables}}

In chapter 3 we introduced and analyzed discrete-time models with
multiple variables representing different demographic groups. In those
models, the populations at the next time step depend on the population
at the current time step in a linear fashion. More generally, any model
with only linear dependencies can be represented in matrix form. In this
chapter we will learn how to analyze the behavior of these models, and
identify all possible classes of linear dynamical systems.

The main concept of this chapter are the special numbers and vectors
associated with a matrix, called eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Any
matrix can be thought of as an operator acting on vectors, and
transforming them in certain ways. Loosely speaking, this transformation
can be expressed in terms of special directions (eigenvectors) and
special numbers that describe what happens along those special
directions. Finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix allows
us to understand the dynamics of biological models by classifying them
into distinct categories.

In the modeling section, we will develop some intuition for modeling
activators and inhibitors of biochemical reactions. We will then learn
how to draw the flow of two-dimensional dynamical systems in the plane.
In the analytical section, we will define eigenvectors and eigenvalues,
and use this knowledge to find the general solution of linear
multi-variable systems. In the computational section, numerical
solutions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors will be applied to classifying
all linear multi-dimensional systems, and to plotting the solutions,
both over time and in the plane. Finally, in the synthesis section we
will use a light-hearted model of relationship dynamics to illustrate
how to analyze linear dynamical systems.

\hypertarget{activators-and-inhibitors-in-biochemical-reactions}{%
\subsection{activators and inhibitors in biochemical
reactions}\label{activators-and-inhibitors-in-biochemical-reactions}}

Suppose two gene products (proteins) regulate each others' expression.
Activator protein \(A\) binds to the promoter of the gene for \(I\) and
activates its expression, while inhibitor protein \(I\) binds to the
promoter of the gene for \(A\) and inhibits its expression (here the
variables stand for concentrations of the two proteins in the cell):

\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot  A & = & - \alpha I\\
\dot  I & = & \beta A\end{aligned}
\]

\(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are positive rate constants. They represent the
rate of inhibition of \(A\) by \(I\), and of activation of \(I\) by
\(A\), respectively. Let us now complicate the model by adding
self-inhibition. It is common for regulatory proteins to inhibit their
own production. Then, we have the following system of equations:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot  A & = & - \gamma A - \alpha I\\
\dot  I & = & \beta A - \delta I
\end{aligned}
\]

Here we have added two rates of self-inhibition \(\gamma\) and
\(\delta\). This is a system of two coupled ODEs, and we will learn how
to analyze these models both analytically and graphically.

\hypertarget{phase-plane-portraits}{%
\subsection{phase plane portraits}\label{phase-plane-portraits}}

Before we learn about the analytical tools of linear algebra, let us
think intuitively about the effect of the variables on each other. The
best way to describe this is through plotting the geometry of the
\emph{flow} prescribed by the differential equations. As we saw, for
one-dimensional ODEs the direction of the change of the dependent
variable (also known as the flow) could be shown as arrows on a line. A
single variable can only increase, decrease, or stay the same (at a
fixed point). In two dimensions there is more freedom. The flow is
plotted on the \emph{phase plane}, where for any combination of the two
variables (say \(x,y\)) the ODE gives the derivatives of \(x\) and
\(y\). This vector gives the flow, or the rate of change at the
particular point in the plane. Intuitively, the flow describes the
direction in which the system is pulling the 2-dimensional solution. If
we plot the progress of a solution of ODE (all the values of \(x\) and
\(y\) starting with the initial condition) we will obtain a
\emph{trajectory} in the phase plane. The arrows of the flow are tangent
to any trajectory curve, since they plot the derivatives of \(x,y\).

\textbf{Example: positive relationship between the variables} Consider
the following system of differential equations:

\[
\\begin{aligned}
\dot x & = & x + y \\
\dot y & = & x + 2y 
\end{aligned}
\] (eq-ode1)

This is system is coupled, with \(x\) having an effect on \(y\) and vice
versa. Specifically, the signs of the constants mean that positive
values of \(x\) have the effect of increasing \(y\) (and vice versa),
while negative values of \(x\) have the effect of decreasing \(y\) (and
vice versa). For any pair of values of \((x,y)\), there is a flow
prescribed by the ODEs. E.g., when \(x=1, y=1\), the derivatives are
\(\dot x = 2, \dot y = 3\). This means that the flow at that point is
given by the vector \((2,3)\), and can be plotted in the \(x,y\) phase
plane. This can be done for any pair of values of \(x\) and \(y\), and
plotted to give the phase plane portrait in figure
\{numref\}\texttt{fig-ode1}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{./images/week6_pp5.png}

}

\caption{Phase plane flow for the system in \{eq\}\texttt{eq-ode1}}

\end{figure}

Observe that the overall dynamics of the systems are directed outward
from the origin, as we expect from the ODEs. The blue lines on the plot
are some sample trajectories. The solution over time for both \(x\) and
\(y\) will either grow toward positive infinity, or decay to negative
infinity.

\textbf{Example: negative relationship between the variables} Consider
the following system of differential equations, where \(y\) has an
effect on \(\dot x\) opposite of its own sign. That is, negative values
of \(y\) contribute to the growth of \(x\), and vice versa.

\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot x & = & -y \\
\dot y & = & x  
\end{aligned}
\] (eq-ode2)

As above, the flow at any one point is given by the ODEs. E.g. at
\((0,1)\) the two derivatives prescribe flow in the \((1,0)\) (up)
direction, while at \((1,0)\) the flow is in the \((0,-1)\) direction.
Figure \{numref\}\texttt{fig-ode2} shows the arrows of flow in the phase
plane around the origin. Note that the arrows go around in a circular
pattern around the origin - this shows oscillatory flow of solutions.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{./images/week6_pp2.png}

}

\caption{Phase plane flow for the system in \{eq\}\texttt{eq-ode2}}

\end{figure}

Let us consider the trajectories of \(x\) and \(y\) in time. The blue
curves in the phase plane plot demonstrate the solutions go around the
origin and return to the same point. This means that the behavior of the
solutions over time is \emph{periodic}, with oscillations going from
positive to negative numbers and back forever.

\hypertarget{basic-linear-algebra-terminology}{%
\subsection{basic linear algebra
terminology}\label{basic-linear-algebra-terminology}}

We have seen matrix notation introduced in the previous chapter, along
with the definition of matrix multiplication. One basic advantage of
this notation is that it makes it possible to write any set of
\emph{linear equations} as a single matrix equation. By linear equations
we mean those that contain only constants or first powers of the
variables. The field of mathematics studying matrices and their
generalizations is called \emph{linear algebra}; it is fundamental to
both pure and applied mathematics. In this section we will learn some
basic facts about matrices and their properties. First of all, let us
define some basic terms:

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, leftrule=.75mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, breakable, opacityback=0, colback=white, toprule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomtitle=1mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, rightrule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Matrix definitions}]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A matrix \(A\) is a rectangular array of \emph{elements} \(A_{ij}\),
  in which \(i\) denotes the row number (index), counted from the top,
  and \(j\) denotes the column number (index), counted from left to
  right.
\item
  The elements of a matrix \(A\) which have the same row and column
  index, e.g.~\(A_{33}\) are called the \emph{diagonal elements}. Those
  which do not lie on the diagonal are called the \emph{off-diagonal}
  elements.
\item
  The \emph{trace} \(\tau\) of a matrix \(A\) is the sum of the diagonal
  elements: \(\tau = \sum_i A_{ii}\)
\item
  The \emph{determinant} \(\Delta\) of a 2x2 matrix \(A\) is given by
  the following: \(\Delta = ad - bc\), where
\end{itemize}

\[
A = \left(\begin{array}{cc}a & b \\c & d\end{array}\right)
\]

For larger matrices, the determinant is defined recursively, in terms of
2x2 submatrices of the larger matrix, but we will not give the full
definition here.

\end{tcolorbox}

For example, in the 3 x 3 matrix below, the elements \(a, e, i\) are the
diagonal elements:

\[
A = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}a & b & c \\d & e & f \\g & h & i\end{array}\right)
\]

In chapter 3 you learned the rule of matrix multiplication, and we can
write \(C = A \times B\), so long as the number of columns in \(A\)
matches the number of rows in \(B\). However, what if we want to reverse
the process? If we know the resulting matrix \(C\), and one of the two
matrices, e.g.~\(A\), how can we find \(B\)? Naively, we would like to
be able to divide both sides by the matrix \(A\), and find \(B = C/A\).
However, things are more complicated for matrices.

Properly speaking, we need to introduce the \emph{inverse} of a matrix
\(A\). If we think about inverses of real numbers, \(a^{-1}\) is a
number that when it multiplies \(a\), results in one. In order to define
the equivalent for matrices, we first need to introduce the unity of
matrix multiplication.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, leftrule=.75mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, breakable, opacityback=0, colback=white, toprule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomtitle=1mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, rightrule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Definition}]
The \emph{identity} matrix is an \(n\) by \(n\) matrix that does not
change another \(n\) by \(n\) matrix by multiplication:

\[
A \times I = I \times A  = A
\]

The diagonal elements of the identity matrix are 1s and all off-diagonal
elements are zero.
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Example:} Useing the definition of matrix multiplication from
chapter 3, we can verify that this definition works for any 2 by 2
matrix:

\[
\begin{pmatrix}-6 & -2 \\ 12 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix}-6\times 1 + -2\times 0 & -6\times 0 + -2\times 1  \\ 12\times 1 -1 \times 0 & 12\times 0 -1 \times 1  \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}-6 & -2 \\ 12 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now that we have specified the identity, we can define the matrix
inverse:

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, leftrule=.75mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, breakable, opacityback=0, colback=white, toprule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomtitle=1mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, rightrule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Definition}]
A square matrix \(A\) has an \emph{inverse matrix} \(A^{-1}\) if it
satisfies the following:

\[
A^{-1} A = A A^{-1} = I
\]
\end{tcolorbox}

Finding the inverse of a matrix is not simple, and we will be content to
let computers handle the dirty work. In fact, not every matrix possesses
an inverse. There is a test for existence of an inverse of \(A\), and it
depends on the determinant (\textbf{strang\_linear\_2005?}):

A square matrix \(A\) possesses an inverse \(A^{-1}\) and is called
\emph{invertible} if and only if its determinant is not zero.

\hypertarget{matrices-transform-vectors}{%
\subsection{matrices transform
vectors}\label{matrices-transform-vectors}}

In this section we will learn to characterize square matrices by finding
special numbers and vectors associated with them. At the core of this
analysis lies the concept of a matrix as an \emph{operator} that
transforms vectors by multiplication, as we defined in chapter 3. To be
clear, in this section we take as default that the matrices \(A\) are
square, and that vectors \(\vec v\) are column vectors, and thus will
multiply the matrix on the right: \(A \times \vec v\).

A matrix multiplied by a vector produces another vector, provided the
number of columns in the matrix is the same as the number of rows in the
vector. This can be interpreted as the matrix transforming the vector
\(\vec v\) into another one: \$ A \times  \vec v = \vec u\$. The
resultant vector \(\vec u\) may or may not resemble \(\vec v\), but
there are special vectors for which the transformation is very simple.

\textbf{Example.} Let us multiply the following matrix and vector
(specially chosen to make a point):

\[
\left(\begin{array}{cc}2 & 1 \\ 2& 3\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}1 \\ -1 \end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{c}2 -1 \\ 2 - 3 \end{array}\right) =  \left(\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ -1 \end{array}\right)
\]

We see that this particular vector is unchanged when multiplied by this
matrix, or we can say that the matrix multiplication is equivalent to
multiplication by 1. Here is another such vector for the same matrix:

\[
\left(\begin{array}{cc}2 & 1 \\ 2& 3\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}1 \\ 2 \end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{c}2 +2 \\ 2 + 6 \end{array}\right) =  \left(\begin{array}{c} 4 \\ 8 \end{array}\right)
\]

In this case, the vector is changed, but only by multiplication by a
constant (4). Thus the geometric direction of the vector remained
unchanged.

Generally, a square matrix has an associated set of vectors for which
multiplication by the matrix is equivalent to multiplication by a
constant. This can be written down as a definition:

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, leftrule=.75mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, breakable, opacityback=0, colback=white, toprule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomtitle=1mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, rightrule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Definition}]
An \emph{eigenvector} of a square matrix \(A\) is a vector \(\vec v\)
for which matrix multiplication by \(A\) is equivalent to multiplication
by a constant. This constant \(\lambda\) is called its \emph{eigenvalue}
of \(A\) corresponding the the eigenvector \(\vec v\). The relationship
is summarized in the following equation:

\[
A  \times  \vec v = \lambda \vec v
\] (def-eigen)
\end{tcolorbox}

Note that this equation combines a matrix (\(A\)), a vector (\(\vec v\))
and a scalar \(\lambda\), and that both sides of the equation are column
vectors. This definition is illustrated in
\{numref\}\texttt{fig-eig-vec}, showing a vector (\(v\)) multiplied by a
matrix \(A\), and the resulting vector \(\lambda v\), which is in the
same direction as \(v\), due to scalar multiplying all elements of a
vector, thus either stretching it if \(\lambda>1\) or compressing it if
\(\lambda < 1\). This assumes that \(\lambda\) is a real number, which
is not always the case, but we will leave that complication aside for
the purposes of this chapter.

\begin{figure}

eigenvector \(v\), resulting in a vector in the same direction
\(\lambda v\). (Figure by Lantonov under CC BY-SA 4.0 via Wikimedia
Commons)}

\end{figure}

The definition does not specify how many such eigenvectors and
eigenvalues can exist for a given matrix \(A\). There are usually as
many such vectors \(\vec v\) and corresponding numbers \(\lambda\) as
the number of rows or columns of the square matrix \(A\), so a 2 by 2
matrix has two eigenvectors and two eigenvalues, a 5x5 matrix has 5 of
each, etc. One ironclad rule is that there cannot be more distinct
eigenvalues than the matrix dimension. Some matrices possess fewer
eigenvalues than the matrix dimension, those are said to have a
\emph{degenerate} set of eigenvalues, and at least two of the
eigenvectors share the same eigenvalue.

The situation with eigenvectors is trickier. There are some matrices for
which any vector is an eigenvector, and others which have a limited set
of eigenvectors. What is difficult about counting eigenvectors is that
an eigenvector is still an eigenvector when multiplied by a constant.
You can show that for any matrix, multiplication by a constant is
commutative: \(cA = Ac\), where \(A\) is a matrix and \(c\) is a
constant. This leads us to the important result that if \(\vec v\) is an
eigenvector with eigenvalue \(\lambda\), then any scalar multiple
\(c \vec v\) is also an eigenvector with the same eigenvalue. The
following demonstrates this algebraically:

\[
A  \times  (c \vec v) = c A  \times  \vec v = c \lambda \vec v =  \lambda (c \vec v)
\]

This shows that when the vector \(c \vec v\) is multiplied by the matrix
\(A\), it results in its being multiplied by the same number
\(\lambda\), so by definition it is an eigenvector. Therefore, an
eigenvector \(\vec v\) is not unique, as any constant multiple
\(c \vec v\) is also an eigenvector. It is more useful to think not of a
single eigenvector \(\vec v\), but of a \textbf{collection of vectors
that can be interconverted by scalar multiplication} that are all
essentially the same eigenvector. Another way to represent this, if the
eigenvector is real, is that an eigenvector as a \textbf{direction that
remains unchanged by multiplication by the matrix}, such as direction of
the vector \(v\) in figure . As mentioned above, this is true only for
real eigenvalues and eigenvectors, since complex eigenvectors cannot be
used to define a direction in a real space.

To summarize, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix are a set of
numbers and a set of vectors (up to scalar multiple) that describe the
action of the matrix as a multiplicative operator on vectors.
``Well-behaved'' square \(n\) by \(n\) matrices have \(n\) distinct
eigenvalues and \(n\) eigenvectors pointing in distinct directions. In a
deep sense, the collection of eigenvectors and eigenvalues defines a
matrix \(A\), which is why an older name for them is characteristic
vectors and values.

\hypertarget{calculating-eigenvalues}{%
\subsection{calculating eigenvalues}\label{calculating-eigenvalues}}

Finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors analytically, that is on paper,
is quite laborious even for 3 by 3 or 4 by 4 matrices and for larger
ones there is no analytical solution. In practice, the task is
outsourced to a computer, and MATLAB has a number of functions for this
purpose. Nevertheless, it is useful to go through the process in 2
dimensions in order to gain an understanding of what is involved. From
the definition {[}def:eigen{]} of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the
condition can be written in terms of the four elements of a 2 by 2
matrix:

\[
\left(\begin{array}{cc}a & b \\c & d\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}v_1 \\ v_2 \end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{c}av_1 +b v_2\\ cv_1+ dv_2 \end{array}\right) = \lambda \left(\begin{array}{c}v_1 \\ v_2 \end{array}\right)
\]

This is now a system of two linear algebraic equations, which we can
solve by substitution. First, let us solve for \(v_1\) in the first row,
to get

\[
v_1 = \frac{-bv_2}{a-\lambda}
\]

Then we substitute this into the second equation and get:

\[
\frac{-bcv_2}{a-\lambda} +(d-\lambda)v_2 = 0
\]

Since \(v_2\) multiplies both terms, and is not necessarily zero, we
require that its multiplicative factor be zero. Doing a little algebra,
we obtain the following, known as the \emph{characteristic equation} of
the matrix:

\[
-bc +(a-\lambda)(d-\lambda) = \lambda^2-(a+d)\lambda +ad-bc = 0
\]

This equation can be simplified by using two quantities we defined at
the beginning of the section: the sum of the diagonal elements called
the trace \(\tau = a+d\), and the determinant \(\Delta = ad-bc\). The
quadratic equation has two solutions, dependent solely on \(\tau\) and
\(\Delta\):

\[
\lambda = \frac{\tau \pm \sqrt{\tau^2-4\Delta}}{2}
\]

This is the general expression for a 2 by 2 matrix, showing there are
two possible eigenvalues. Note that if \(\tau^2-4\Delta>0\), the
eigenvalues are real, if \(\tau^2-4\Delta<0\), they are complex (have
real and imaginary parts), and if \(\tau^2-4\Delta=0\), there is only
one eigenvalue. This situation is known as degenerate, because two
eigenvectors share the same eigenvalue.

\textbf{Example.} Let us take the same matrix we looked at in the
previous subsection:

\[
A = \left(\begin{array}{cc}2 & 1 \\ 2& 3\end{array}\right)
\]

The trace of this matrix is \(\tau = 2+3 =5\) and the determinant is
\(\Delta = 6 - 2 = 4\). Then by our formula, the eigenvalues are:

\[
\lambda = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{5^2-4 \times 4}}{2}  =  \frac{5 \pm 3}{2}  = 4, 1
\]

These are the multiples we found in the example above, as expected.

A real matrix can have complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors, but
whenever it acts on a real vector, the result is still real. This is
because the complex numbers cancel each other's imaginary parts. For
discrete time models, it is enough to consider the absolute value of a
complex eigenvalue, which is defined as following:
\(|a +b i|= \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). As before, the eigenvalue with the
largest absolute value ``wins'' in the long term.

\hypertarget{calculation-of-eigenvectors-on-paper}{%
\subsection{calculation of eigenvectors on
paper}\label{calculation-of-eigenvectors-on-paper}}

The surprising fact is that, as we saw in the last subsection, the
eigenvalues of a matrix can be found without knowing its eigenvectors!
However, the converse is not true: to find the eigenvectors, one first
needs to know the eigenvalues. Given an eigenvalue \(\lambda\), let us
again write down the defining equation of the eigenvector for a generic
2 by 2 matrix:

\[
\left(\begin{array}{cc}a & b \\c & d\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}v_1 \\ v_2 \end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{c}av_1 +b v_2\\ cv_1+ dv_2 \end{array}\right) = \lambda \left(\begin{array}{c}v_1 \\ v_2 \end{array}\right)
\]

This vector equation is equivalent to two algebraic equations:

\[
\begin{aligned}
av_1 + b v_2 &= \lambda v_1 \\
cv_1 + d v_2 &= \lambda v_2 
\end{aligned}
\]

Since we've already found \(\lambda\) by solving the characteristic
equation, this is two linear equations with two unknowns (\(v_1\) and
\(v_2\)). You may remember from advanced algebra that such equations may
either have a single solution for each unknown, but sometimes they may
have none, or infinitely many solutions. Since there are unknowns on
both sides of the equation, we can make both equations be equal to zero:

\[\begin{aligned}
(a-\lambda)v_1 + b v_2 &= 0 \\
cv_1 + (d-\lambda ) v_2 &=0
\end{aligned}
\]

So the first equation yields the relationship
\(v_1 = -v_2 b/(a-\lambda)\) and the second equation is
\(v_1 = -v_2(d-\lambda)/c\), which we already obtained in the last
subsection. We know that these two equations must be the same, since the
ratio of \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) is what defines the eigenvector. So we can
use either expression to find the eigenvector.

\textbf{Example.} Let us return to the same matrix we looked at in the
previous subsection:

\[
A = \left(\begin{array}{cc}2 & 1 \\ 2& 3\end{array}\right)
\]

The eigenvalues of the matrix are 1 and 4. Using our expression above,
where the element \(a=2\) and \(b=1\), let us find the eigenvector
corresponding to the eigenvalue 1:

\[
v_1 = - v_2 \times  1/(2-1) = - v_2
\]

Therefore the eigenvector is characterized by the first and second
elements being negatives of each other. We already saw in the example
two subsections above that the vector \((1,-1)\) is such as eigenvector,
but it is also true of the vectors \((-1,1)\), \((-\pi, \pi)\) and
\((10^6, -10^6)\). This infinite collection of vectors, all along the
same direction, can be described as the eigenvector (or eigendirection)
corresponding to the eigenvalue 1.

Repeating this procedure for \(\lambda = 4\), we obtain the linear
relationship: \[v_1 = - v_2 \times  1/(2-4) = 0.5 v_2\] Once again, the
example vector we saw two subsections \((2,1)\) is in agreement with our
calculation. Other vectors that satisfy this relationship include
\((10,5)\), \((-20,-10)\), and \((-0.4,-0.2)\). This is again a
collection of vectors that are all considered the same eigenvector with
eigenvalue 4 which are all pointing in the same direction, with the only
difference being their length.

\hypertarget{solutions-of-linear-two-variable-odes}{%
\section{Solutions of linear two-variable
ODEs}\label{solutions-of-linear-two-variable-odes}}

Let us start by considering two variable ODEs that do not affect each
other:

\textbf{Example: two uncoupled ODEs} In general, for a two-variable
system, the value of one variable affects the other. In the equations
above, the terms with the constants \(b\) and \(c\) provide what is
known as \emph{coupling} between the two variables. Let us look at the
primitive situation where the two variables are uncoupled, as an
illustration of solving two-dimensional ODEs. If we set the coupling
constants \(b\) and \(c\) to 0, we get:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot x & = & ax \\
\dot y & = & dy
\end{aligned}
\]

Using our knowledge of 1D linear ODE, we can solve the two equations
independently to get the following: \(x(t) = x_0 e^{at}\) and
\(y(t) = y_0 e^{dt}\). The solutions can be written in vector form:

\[
\left(\begin{array}{c}x(t) \\y(t)\end{array}\right) =
x_0 e^{at} \left(\begin{array}{c}1 \\0\end{array}\right)+y_0 e^{dt}\left(\begin{array}{c}0\\1\end{array}\right)
\]

This is another way of writing that the dynamics of variable \(x\) is
exponential growth (or decay) with rate \(a\), and ditto \(y\), with
rate \(d\). Given the initial conditions \((x_0, y_0)\), we can divide
the behavior of the solutions into a sum of two vectors, each growing or
decaying at its own rate.

Linear algebra allows us to find the solution for two-dimensional ODEs
where the variables are interdependent using the same idea. The general
(homogeneous) ODE with two dependent variables can be written as
follows:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot x & = & ax + by \\
\dot y & = & cx + dy
\end{aligned}
\]

We can write this in matrix form like this:

\[
\left(\begin{array}{c}\dot x \\ \dot y \end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{cc}a & b \\c & d\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}x \\ y \end{array}\right)
\]

Let us call the matrix \(A\), and represent the vector \((x,y)\) as
\(\vec {x}\), then the general linear equation can be written like this:

\[
\dot{ \vec{ x}} = A \vec{x}
\] (gen-lin-mult)

This notation is intended to make plain the similarity with the linear
1D ODE: \(\dot x = a x\). This similarity is deep and substantial, in
that linear equations in multiple dimensions share the same basic
exponential form. In general, all solutions of linear equations can be
written as a sum of exponentials multiplying different vectors:

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, leftrule=.75mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, breakable, opacityback=0, colback=white, toprule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomtitle=1mm, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, rightrule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, title={General solution of linear 2-variable ODEs}]
\[
\left(\begin{array}{c} x(t) \\  y(t) \end{array}\right) =C_1e^{\lambda_1 t} \left(\begin{array}{c}x_1\\y_1\end{array}\right)+C_2 e^{\lambda_2 t}\left(\begin{array}{c}x_2\\y_2\end{array}\right)
\] (gen-sol-2var)

The constants \(C_1, C_2\) are determined by the initial conditions,
while the constants \(\lambda_1, \lambda_2\) are the eigenvalues and the
vectors \((x_1,y_1)\) and \((x_2,y_2)\) are the eigenvectors of the
matrix \(A\). We will now consider the application of this general
result using computational tools.
\end{tcolorbox}

\hypertarget{classification-of-linear-systems}{%
\section{Classification of linear
systems}\label{classification-of-linear-systems}}

We have seen that linear algebra allows us to write down the solution of
a multivariable dynamical system into a sum of exponential terms. In
this section we use computational techniques to find the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of a system, and then produce the \emph{phase portraits} of
the linear systems. There are only a few different types of flow
possible for linear systems, and we will classify them.

\hypertarget{real-eigenvalues}{%
\subsection{real eigenvalues}\label{real-eigenvalues}}

Let us consider the fixed points of the linear system: since both
\$\dot x =0 \$ and \(\dot y = 0\) must be zero, the only fixed point is
the origin \((0,0)\). We will see that the stability of the fixed point
depends on the sign of the real part of the eigenvalue.

Suppose we have a positive real eigenvalue. The solution in the
direction of the corresponding eigenvector is then described by
\(Ce^{\lambda t}\), \(\lambda > 0\), which is exponential growth. The
means that the solution is going to grow in the direction of the
eigenvector away from the origin, and thus the origin is an unstable
fixed point (in this direction). This type of fixed point is called an
\emph{unstable node}.

On the other hand, if \(\lambda < 0\) for both eigenvalues, the solution
decays exponentially and thus approaches the origin, so the fixed point
is stable. This type of fixed point is called a \emph{stable node}.

Since there are two different eigenvalues, one may be positive while
another is negative. In this case, the fixed point is is called a
\emph{saddle point} for geometric reasons: solutions flow toward it in
one direction, like a marble along the forward-backward axis of a saddle
on a horse and flow away from it along the sideways direction on a
saddle. Then, the fixed point is stable when approached along one
eigenvector, but unstable along the other. What happens if the initial
condition is not on either eigenvector? I will use a fact of linear
algebra that given any two (non-colinear) 2D vectors, any vector in the
plane can represented as a sum (with some coefficients) of these two.
Thus, the general solution can be written as follows:

\[
\left(\begin{array}{c} x(t) \\  y(t) \end{array}\right) =C_1e^{at} \left(\begin{array}{c}v_1\\v_2\end{array}\right)+C_2 e^{-bt}\left(\begin{array}{c}u_1\\u_2\end{array}\right)
\]

where \(a,b>0\). Then we see that the component in the direction of the
first eigenvector will grow, while the component along the second
eigenvector will decay. Thus, as \(t \rightarrow \infty\), all solutions
will approach the vector with the unstable eigenvalue, except those with
initial conditions right on the eigenvector corresponding to the stable
eigenvalue. This means that the fixed point is essentially unstable,
because only trajectories which start exactly along the stable direction
approach the fixed point in the long run, while others, may approach the
fixed point for a finite time, flow away when the unstable component
with the positive eigenvalue takes over, as shown in figure .

{[}Phase plane flow for a linear system with a saddle point{]}
(images/week6\_pp1.png)

\hypertarget{complex-eigenvalues}{%
\subsection{complex eigenvalues}\label{complex-eigenvalues}}

If the argument of the square root is negative, eigenvalues may be
complex numbers, which we can write like this: \(a+bi\). Using Euler's
formula, we can write down the time-dependent part of the solutions as
the following:

\[
e^{(a + bi)t} = e^{at}e^{bit}= e^{at}(\cos(bt)+i\sin(bt))
\]

The behavior of these solutions combines exponential growth or decay
from the real part, with the oscillations produced by the imaginary
part. This describes either exponentially growing or decaying
oscillations, which look like decaying waves in time, or as a spiral in
the phase plane:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{./images/lec7_exp_osc.png}

}

\caption{Exponentially decaying oscillations in the time plot of the
solution \(x(t)\)}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{./images/lec7_pp1.png}

}

\caption{Phase plane portrait of a stable spiral}

\end{figure}

Thus we see that the stability of the fixed point with complex
eigenvalues depends on the sign of the real part. Purely imaginary
eigenvalues produce periodic oscillations, which keep the same
amplitude, as we saw in the example in the modeling section.

Eigenvalues of linear ODEs define type of phase plane

The table above summarizes all the different types of flows in the phase
plane possible for linear systems, in terms of the behavior of solutions
relative to the fixed point at the origin. If the eigenvalues are real,
the solutions will be exponential in nature. There are three
possibilities for nonzero eigenvalues: \emph{stable node} (both
eigenvalues are negative), \emph{unstable node} (both eigenvalues are
positive), and a \emph{saddle point} (mixed signs). If one of the
eigenvalues is zero, this means that there is not flow along one
direction, so there is a \emph{line of fixed points} in the direction of
the corresponding eigenvector (if both eigenvalues are zero, there is no
flow at all.)

For complex eigenvalues, there are three possibilities: if the real part
is positive, the solution will grow and oscillate (oscillations with
exponentially increasing amplitude), if the real part is negative, the
solution will decay and oscillation (oscillations with exponentially
increasing amplitude), and if the real part is zero (pure
imaginary~eigenvalues) the solution will oscillate with constant
amplitude. The first type is called an \emph{unstable spiral}, the
second a \emph{stable spiral}, and the third a \emph{center}. It is not
possible for complex eigenvalues of two-dimensional systems to have
different signs of real parts, because as the formula shows, the real
part is the same for both and is equal to the trace divided by two.

\hypertarget{dynamics-of-romantic-relationships}{%
\section{Dynamics of romantic
relationships}\label{dynamics-of-romantic-relationships}}

We examine a model, taken from (\textbf{strogatz\_nonlinear\_2001?}),
that applies dynamical systems modeling to a pressing concern for many
humans: the prediction of dynamics of a romantic relationship. There are
several unrealistic assumptions involved in the following model: first,
that love or affection can be quantified, second, that any changes in
relationship depend only on the emotions of the two people involved, and
third, that the rate of change of the two love variables depend linearly
on each other.

If we can give those assumptions the benefit of the doubt (which is how
all relationships begin), we can write down a system of ODEs to describe
a romantically involved couple. Here \(X\) and \(Y\) are dynamic
variables that quantify the emotional states of the two lovers:

\[\
begin{aligned}
\dot  X & = & aX+ bY \\
\dot  Y & = & cX + dY
\end{aligned}
\]

Let us denote positive feelings (love) with positive values of \(X,Y\),
while negative values signify negative feelings (hate.) The significance
of the parameters can be interpreted as follows: \(a,d\) describe the
response of the two people to their own feelings, while \(b,c\)
correspond to the effect the other person's feeling has on their own.
For example, a person whose feeling grow as the other person's affection
increases can be modeled with a positive value of \(b\) (or \(c\)). On
the other hand, a person whose own feelings are dampened by the other
one's excessively positive emotions, can be decribed by a negative value
of \(b\) or \(c\). Their own feelings can also play a role, either
positive or negative, reflected in the sign of the constants \(a\) and
\(d\).

Using mathematical modeling, we can answer the following basic
questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Given a set of values for parameters \(a, b, c, d\), predict the
  dynamic behavior of the model relationship.
\item
  Find conditions for stability and existence of oscillations in the
  dynamical system, expressed as a function of the parameters.
\end{enumerate}

To address the first question, here are some simplified scenarios for
our two lovers in the model.

\textbf{Detached lovers:} Let the emotional state of the two lovers
depend only on their own emotions, for example:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot  X & = & X \\
\dot  Y & = &  -Y
\end{aligned}
\]

To classify the behavior of the model, we find the eigenvalues of the
system. In this case, they are the diagonal elements of the matrix, 1
and -1. This mean that the origin is a saddle point, and therefore it is
unstable. In the \(X\) direction, the emotions are going to grow without
bound, either in the love or hate direction, while in the \(Y\)
direction, the emotions are going to decay to zero (indifference). This
should be no surprise, that since the two equations are independent, the
lovers have no emotional effect on each other.

\textbf{Lovers with no self-awareness:} Here is an alternate situation:
suppose two lovers were not influenced by their own emotions, but were
instead attuned to the emotional state of the other. Then we might have
the following model, in which lover \(X\) reacts in the opposite way by
emotions of lover \(Y\), but lover \(Y\) is, contrariwise, spurred by
the love or hate of \(X\) in the same direction:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot  X & = & -Y \\
\dot  Y & = &  X
\end{aligned}
\]

We find the eigenvalues of the system by using the expression in
equation {[}eg:2D\_eig{]}: \(\lambda = (0 \pm \sqrt{-4})/2 = \pm i\).
Pure imaginary eigenvalues tell us that the origin is a center point,
with the solutions periodic orbits around the origin. Psychologically,
we can interpret this scenario as cycles of love and hate, never growing
and never decaying. The magnitude of these oscillations depends on the
initial state of the system, that is, the feelings the lovers had at the
beginning of the relationship.

We can now address the second question, and find under what
circumstances different types of dynamic behaviors occur. We consider
the general model, and ask what kinds of eigenvalues are possible for
different parameter values. First, we write down the general expression
for the eigenvalues, from equation {[}eg:2D\_eig{]}:

\[
\lambda =  \frac{a+d \pm \sqrt{(a+d)^2-4(ad-bc)}}{2}
\]

There are two properties we are interested in: stability and existence
of oscillations. Recall that stability is determined by the sign of the
real part of the eigenvalues. If the square root is imaginary, then the
real part is simply the trace (\(a+d\)), but if the square root is real,
we have to consider the whole expression to determine stability. So let
us first state the condition for existence of oscillations (imaginary
square root):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Complex eigenvalues: oscillatory solutions \(4(ad-bc) > (a+d)^2\). If
  this expression holds, the square root is imaginary, and the stability
  is determined by the sign of the trace. That is, if \(a+d > 0\), the
  system is unstable, and will grow into unbounded love or hate, but if
  \(a+d < 0\), then the system is stable, and will spiral to
  indifference. The special case \(a+d = 0\), such as we saw above,
  means that strictly periodic love/hate cycles are the solutions.
\item
  Real eigenvalues: exponential growth and/or decay
  \(4(ad-bc) < (a+d)^2\). In this case, the square root is real, and no
  oscillatory solutions exist. In order to determine whether this
  implies exponential growth, decay, or a combination, we must weigh the
  relative sizes of \((a+d)\) and \(\sqrt{(a+d)^2-4(ad-bc)}\). If
  \(|a+d| > \sqrt{(a+d)^2-4(ad-bc)}\), then adding or subtracting the
  square root does not change the sign of \((a+d)\): if it is negative,
  both eigenvalues are negative, and the origin is a stable node, and if
  the trace is positive, the origin is an unstable node. However, if the
  absolute value of the root outweighs the absolute value of the trace
  \(|a+d| < \sqrt{(a+d)^2-4(ad-bc)}\) , then either adding or
  subtracting the root will change the sign of the eigenvalues.
  Therefore, one eigenvalue is positive and the other is negative, and
  the origin is a saddle point. The emotions will run unchecked in some
  preferred direction, possibly combining love and hate of the two
  lovers.
\end{enumerate}

These conditions are not intuitive, and it took some work to express
them. The benefit is that now, given any values of the self-involvement
parameters \(a,d\) and the sensitivity parameters \(b,c\) we can predict
the long-term dynamics of the model relationship. Whether the results
have any bearing on reality, of course, depends on how well the reality
is described by these primitive assumptions.

\subsection{phase plane plots via
quiver}\label{phase-plane-plots-via-quiver}}

We are going to plot phase diagrams for linear ODEs that have the form

\[
dx/dt = a*x + b*y \\
dy/dt = c*x + d*y
\]

Python's \texttt{ax.quiver()} function allows displays vectors with
arrows made of the components \((u,v)\), which is exactly what we need.
The function takes 4 inputs \((x,y,u,v)\): \(x\) and \(y\) are the grid
points and \(u\) and \(v\) are the \(u\) and \(v\) components of the
vector, which are given by our ODEs.

In order to make the grid points \((x,y)\), we will use the function
\texttt{np.meshgrid()}. It's a pretty handy function that takes as input
a range of \(x\) and \(y\) values and returns two matrices \(x\), \(y\)
that together give us the grid points. Here is the code to produce a
grid with an \(x\) and \(y\) range from (-1.5, 1.5) with a spacing of
0.2, we could do the following:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{xmin }\OperatorTok{=} \OperatorTok{{-}}\FloatTok{1.5} \CommentTok{\#change the parameters here to control the range of the axes}
\NormalTok{xmax }\OperatorTok{=} \FloatTok{1.5}
\NormalTok{ymin }\OperatorTok{=} \OperatorTok{{-}}\FloatTok{1.5}
\NormalTok{ymax }\OperatorTok{=} \FloatTok{1.5}
\NormalTok{dx }\OperatorTok{=} \FloatTok{0.2} \CommentTok{\#set the size of the x{-}step on the grid}
\NormalTok{dy }\OperatorTok{=} \FloatTok{0.2} \CommentTok{\#set the size of the y{-}step on the grid}
\NormalTok{X }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ np.arange(xmin, xmax, dx)}
\NormalTok{Y }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ np.arange(ymin, ymax, dy)}
\NormalTok{x, y }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ np.meshgrid(X,Y) }\CommentTok{\#create a grid}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Define the arrays dx and dy based on the ODE in order to compute the
flow vectors on that grid. Here is a linear example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{a }\OperatorTok{=} \OperatorTok{{-}}\DecValTok{2}
\NormalTok{b }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{1}
\NormalTok{c }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{1}
\NormalTok{d }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{0}
\NormalTok{dx }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ a}\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{x}\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{b}\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{y }\CommentTok{\#overwrites the other dx}
\NormalTok{dy }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ c}\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{x}\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{d}\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{y }\CommentTok{\#overwrites the other dy}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Then plot the arrows given by arrays dx,dy at points x,y:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fig, ax }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ plt.subplots()}
\NormalTok{q }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ ax.quiver(x, y, dx, dy)}
\NormalTok{plt.xlabel(}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}x\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{plt.ylabel(}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}y\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{plt.title(}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Phase plane example\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{plt.show()}
\end{Highlighting}

\subsection{ODE solutions using
odeint}\label{ode-solutions-using-odeint}}

Python has an entire suite of ode solvers. We'll use the function
\texttt{odeint}, with documentation provided here:
\url{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.odeint.html}

This requires defining a function \texttt{fun} that sets the two
functions for the two-variable ODE, to be called by the \texttt{odeint},
together with parameter values a, b, c, d.~There are many other options
that you can read about in the documentation page. Here is the sample
code:
